if the Sufi way is built firmly upon two foundations, namely, eslăm or submission to God (the practice of the shari'at) and imān or faith (assent in the heart to the basic Islamic teachings concerning God, prophecy, and the Last Day), then I'm afraid Western civilization is radically sufi, only that they practice submission to Money, and faith in that the system will not collapse

This “central” role of Sufism at the heart of the Islamic world may be veiled from those who examine it from outside because esoterism, while it is conscious of the significance of forms, is at the same time in a position of intellectual sovereignty in relation to them and can thus assimilate to itself—at any rate for the exposition of its doctrine— certain ideas or symbols derived from a heritage different from its own traditional background

Doctrine grows, not so much by the addition of new knowledge, as by the need to refute errors and to reanimate a diminishing power of intuition

This is not a society that has lost values, a society whose belief system is infected. Nor is it a meaningless society. It is, on the contrary, a society organized to survive its own stupidity. And that is the very sin
