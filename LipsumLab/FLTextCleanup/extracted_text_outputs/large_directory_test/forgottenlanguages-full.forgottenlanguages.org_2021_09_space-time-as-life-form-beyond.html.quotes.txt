The minimum information a life form can host is the information that allows the life form to replicate. That's the very signature of life: to replicate itself. Natural biosystems have evolved by incorporating to that minimum information mechanisms to adapt to the environment, and hence to guarantee replication. Higher life forms have utterly develop mechanisms to modify the environment in which they thrive. The dynamics of these evolutionary solutions can be used to characterize space-time not just as a mere physical entity, but also as a life form

Replicability is only relevant for those phenomena that are embedded in space and time. A general characteristic of such phenomena is spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity. However, if we wish to confer space-time the characteristics of a life-form, spatial dependence is out of the question, while spatial heterogeneity is not

the only reality is that grounded in language; if one wishes to reject language as a foundation then the problem of sceptical doubt arises again and again
