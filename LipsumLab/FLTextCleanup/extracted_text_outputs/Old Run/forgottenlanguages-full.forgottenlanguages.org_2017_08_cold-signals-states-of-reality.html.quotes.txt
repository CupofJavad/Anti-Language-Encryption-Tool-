These so-called cold signals are periodic spectral modulation signals only detected in a very specific and small region of space, the very same region from where events above 10

The anthropic view is the only one we humans can sustain. Obviously, we are not ants, so it would be totally impossible for us to have an ant-view-of-the-Universe. The anthropic view is encoded in the stupid and arrogant statement that we live in this world because it is favorable to intelligent observers. This assumes that we are intelligent, and that we are observers, while the case may be that we are retarded, and we are the ones being observed by truly intelligent beings

Your intelligence is nothing but an expression of your being Turing machines. And do not forget that Turing machines excel in creating other Turing machines. Your consciousness is also a Turing machine. This is a catch 22 situation

Physical laws are the same at any point and at any time. It doesn't matter if you move at different velocities, or even if your movement is accelerated. This is what the principle of relativity teaches. Physical laws are the same everywhere, anytime, and for anyone, and it doesn't matter if you are dead or alive. However, physical laws change depending on whether you are in an awake or dream state. Dreams are probably the only realm where the laws of physics collapse. In a way, falling into a black hole is like dreaming, you see, and dreaming is what you are now doing

Syn3.0 is today the minimal synthetic bacterial cell. Tomorrow it can rule your planet. But our interest lies on finding just the opposite, that is, the maximal life-form. As it happens, the extended zoo hypothesis has it that those now observing you are also being observed. It is a zoo withing a zoo. Actually, the entire Universe seems to be just that: a zoo someone external to it observes
