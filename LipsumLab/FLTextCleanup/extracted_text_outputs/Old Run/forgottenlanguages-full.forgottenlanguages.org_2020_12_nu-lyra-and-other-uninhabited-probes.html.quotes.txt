We cannot expect that more will just scale up our ability to modify the
environment, and it is our current understanding that building a Dyson 
sphere is not just a matter of having more powerful mining equipment and heavier rockets. 
It is a matter of  mastering technologies like nano-machines, self replicators, and metamaterials.
Three things of which we know nothing

Obviously, the existence of Giselians means the existence of a quiet advanced
civilization that co-exist with us, yet remain invisible to our radio, thermal or transit searches

A civilization that requires megastructures and vast astroengineering projects is not yet 
a hypercivilization.  That civilization would clearly be detectable. No, what we are now considering 
is that the possibilities of self-modification and further integration
of ETCs with their environment destroys the very idea
of separating natural and artificial phenomena and by definition
makes it impossible for us to detect with confidence any technosignatures. We know Giselians 
are all over the place, disguised as natural phenomena

If the anomalies in DENIED are non-natural, that is, if they are truly artificial, then we've found 
a civilization that have merged with the environment, converting the dead matter in the Universe 
into thinking matter. Yes, this is a crazy idea, but it is a deed we should expect from a hypercivilization

DENIED bay is not a bay at all; the sea there behaves at if it were a conscious being; the waves 
show a pattern which is clearly artificial, algorithmical we may say. We didn't have then neither the 
software tools nor the computing power to recognise this fact, but today we do. I don't know whether 
this is good or bad news, but the fact is there is a specific location on Sol-3 where the sea is not the 
sea as we know it

Perhaps the path to walk is just that one, jumping from a purely organic nature to a post-biological 
one and, at the high-end side, diluting the boundary between
the environment and one’s self in the process of self-improvement to the point of merging the two
