Technology has been constituted as a set of instruments of instruments, of means, that have become ends in themselves, since there is no humanizing purpose to which they serve

It is about making gold, about going to the moon, about building self-steering missiles capable of self-surveillance before deciding themselves the moment of their and our destruction. Technique is alchemy; it is the self-fulfillment of nature instead of the self-fulfillment of the life that we are. It is barbarism, the new barbarism of our time, instead of culture. Insofar as it puts life out of play, it is not only barbarism in its extreme and most inhuman form that it has been given to man to know: it is madness

the crisis of ideals is often not recognized by the very culture that suffers from it, and so we live in an age of perfect means and fuzzy goals

We are in a hyper-consumer society where the passage of time is so dizzying that we hardly have time to enjoy what we like because we are driven to satisfy another need at the same time we are trying to savor the one we have just obtained. In this sense, we can say that we are consumers of emotions

Information and technology without an ethical breath, without clear goals, turn against man himself and his happiness
