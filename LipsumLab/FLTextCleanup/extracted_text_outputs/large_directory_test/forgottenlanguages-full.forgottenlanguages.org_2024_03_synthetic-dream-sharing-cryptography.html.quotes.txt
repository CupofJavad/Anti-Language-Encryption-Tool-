These systems extract biometric information to generate cryptographic keys for protecting secured data by encryption. However, biometrics such as fingerprint, face, voice, and handwriting contain biometric information that is unique and repeatable for each individual but are difficult to change. Dreams, on the contrary, can be modified ad libitum: you are free to dream of whatever you wish

The use of EEG signal has several benifits: it is recorded while performing a secret mental task that cannot be perceived; it is very hard to imitate because EEG is dependent on mental tasks, and it is impossible to be stolen because EEG is unable to be regenerated by forcing under stress while the brain activity is very sensitive to the stress and mood. Thus, EEG signals a suitable biometric modality in the key generation field in the sense that it would be easy to immediately remove any compromised key and produce a new cryptographic key or generate an additional key for possible applications. On the other hand, is very easy to transform EEG signals into truly random sequences of bits with a high success rate. EEG are true random number generators because they use no seeds

You need a dreamer, and you need a dreamer dreaming the same dream. Yet human dreamers are subject to emotions, such as negative and positive feelings, all of which impact on then EEG signal, and hence emotions may influence on the system. So you need to induce a consistent dream, which is achieved using synthetic dreams, but you also need an enhanced dreamer, that is, a dreamer that could control his/her emotions

Any EEG-based cryptographic key generation system is based on an assumption that EEG signal is quasi-stationary if the time window is sufficiently short. However, NREM sleep in humans consists of alternating brain states whose temporal dynamics determine whether conscious experience arises

There are three alternative measurements of human dreaming – neural correlates of dreaming, replay of newly-acquired memories, and dream-enacting behaviors. Consider how these may be applied to non-human animal models. We have found that while animals close in brain structure to humans (such as mammals and birds) may be optimal models for the first two of these measurements, cephalopods, especially octopuses, are particularly good candidates for the third

In other species, linking brain activity to behavior is done by implanting electrodes and directly correlating electrical activity with observed animal behavior. However, because the octopus lacks any hard structure to which recording equipment can be anchored, and because it uses its eight flexible arms to remove any foreign object attached to the outside of its body, in vivo recording of electrical activity from untethered, behaving octopuses has thus far not been possible. We have developed a novel technique for inserting a portable data logger into the octopus and implanting electrodes into the vertical lobe system, such that brain activity can be recorded for up to 12 h from unanesthetized, untethered octopuses and can be synchronized with simultaneous video recordings of behavior

Creating synthetic dreams and synchronizing dreamers to dream the same dream simultaneously makes it possible to encode and share information in a way that transcends physical barriers. Shared dreams provide a direct and immersive way for individuals to interact with each other in a shared dreamscape. It is our understanding that dreams can be used as a cryptographic method by incorporating them into the encryption process. This can be done through various methods, such as using dream symbols or imagery in the encryption algorithm

One potential approach to doing this involves using machine learning algorithms to analyze the EEG signals and identify patterns that correspond to specific elements of the dream. These patterns can then be used to generate a visual representation of the dream, such as through a video or animation. Another potential approach is through the use of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which allow individuals to communicate with computers using their thoughts. By recording EEG signals during sleep and then using these signals to control a BCI device, it may be possible to reconstruct a dream from the resulting patterns

The idea here is to hace two lucid dreamers to meet in a synthetic dreamscape. The meeting of two lucid dreamers has profound implications for our understanding of consciousness and the nature of reality. But there is a problem we need to overcome. See, in a lucid dream, communication can be more intuitive and direct. Two lucid dreamers can share thoughts, emotions, and even memories without the constraints of language or physical bodies. This, in principle, is what we are up to for what concerns communications with non-terrestrial intelligences. But it is extremely difficult to maintain a coherent shared dream space for two dreamers. We would like one of the dreamers to be synthetic, but so far nobody knows how to turn an AI system into a lucid dreamer

In February 2022, cryptographers found a fatal flaw in Rainbow, an algorithm that had survived three rounds of NIST’s analysis. As for SIKE, based on isogeny made up of connections between elliptic curves, it was broken in just a few hours of computing time using an ordinary desktop computer. They cracked it because they inadvertently found a way to expose enough connecting points to give away the entire thing. But if one or some of the computations have been made in a shared dreamscape, then there would not have been a way you could have broken the algorithm
