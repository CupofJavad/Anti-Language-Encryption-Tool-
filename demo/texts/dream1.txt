Private Dreamlog Entry 6.16.22

Huge massive tree among this coast where I recognize coming here for the maybe they second time but only after mentioning it. The tree has these massive swinging branches with petals/flowers attached to bottom that cup or fold out. There are different statues of animals and extremely oversized animals running around. You see a dark beautiful woman swinging on a swing, then approach a white woman who comes off as initially very attractive…somehow she knows your name upfront and you soon realize the meetup was a setup. The question “You don’t think your worth all this?” Possibly about your drug use? Possibly this is a real life projection of donkey Kong map ? Tree of life visit?
