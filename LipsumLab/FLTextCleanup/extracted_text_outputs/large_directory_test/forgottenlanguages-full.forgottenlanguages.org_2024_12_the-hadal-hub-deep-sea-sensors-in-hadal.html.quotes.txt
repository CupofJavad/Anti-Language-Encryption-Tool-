It is essentially a distributed computing system. It consists of a network of advanced sensors deployed in the Hadal Zone, which are connected through a sophisticated underwater communication network. These sensors are capable of measuring various physical and chemical properties of the deep-sea environment in real-time. The sensors collect vast amounts of data, which are then transmitted to a central processing unit located on land. The central processing unit is equipped with state-of-the-art supercomputing technology, allowing it to process the enormous datasets received from the deep sea

The sensors, which are designed to mimic the biological functions of marine organisms, can detect and measure various physical and chemical phenomena in the deep sea. These measurements are then used as input for the computational models. There is a layer in the hadal computing architecture which is comprised by seafloor sensors aimed at analyzing the ocean's behavior and dynamics. Each hadal sensor is basically a ocean thermal energy micro-converter. The device can make a range of decisions, from simple calculations to complex optimisations, and each sensor is able to adjust its parameters to optimise its performance, which allows the entire network to adapt to changing conditions

The sensors appeared to be self-sustaining, drawing energy from the thermal vents and utilizing the unique chemical compounds found in the deep-sea environment. The sensors seemed to be actively monitoring their activities, adjusting their functions in response to human interference. This led to theories that the devices were not merely passive remnants but rather part of a larger, sentient system designed to observe and perhaps even communicate with intelligent life forms

In the hadal zone pressure is so high that you cannot hope to design mechanical sensors. What we do is to re-engineer hadal life-forms, in particular some species of cnidarians, by encapsulating specialized circuitry either in the bell, oral arms, and in the mesoglea. Some subjects are also implanted with optical sensors inserted in the statocysts. These modified life-forms operate in the hadalpelagic zone, withstanding 1,000 times the atmospheric pressure at sea level, and they operate at temperatures often ranging from about 1 to 4 degrees Celsius, in complete darkness

Cnidarians have the ability to repair damaged tissue, therefore implanting our sensors and optical wires causes no problem. They possess a remarkable capacity for regeneration, which allows them to heal wounds and regenerate lost body parts. When a cnidarian is injured, the cells at the wound site can migrate and proliferate to close the wound. This process often involves the formation of a new layer of tissue over the damaged area. The main problem is that the efficiency of regeneration is influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, availability of nutrients, and the presence of stressors, and we cannot fully replicate the hadal conditions in the lab

Our modified organisms are designed to communicate using a very weak communications model based on flash light pulses and silence. We initially really some thousands of life-forms, building up a very weak network communications model in which information can be passed only in the form of a light flash or a lack thereof. Basically, the network is modeled as an undirected connected graph where vertices in the graph represent organisms in the network, and edges represent direct reachability. Time is divided into discrete steps, with a synchronized global clock. In each time-step every node decides whether to emit a flash or to listen. Nodes which choose to listen in a particular time-step detect a flash of light if at least one of their neighbors chose to emit light, and they cannot distinguish between one neighbor flashing or many

A source node begins with a message of which to inform all other nodes. Since messages must, in effect, be transmitted bit by bit in a pattern of light pulses and silence, algorithmic running time is affected by the length of the message we must transmit. Once a source organism transmit a pulse all other nodes aim to relay any beep coming from a neighbor one hop closer to the source, in the next time-step after they detect the pulse of light. Of course, nodes do not know the provenance of pulses they detect, but we can ensure that nodes will not detect any pulses from their own layer since they will themselves be flashing rather than listening

A subnetwork of cubomedusae developed a coordinated obstacle avoidance strategy, which is just one form of hive mind emergence we observed which does not appear in natural, unmodified specimens. In these organisms, the photoreceptor systems control the swim pacemaker, while in hydrozoan medusae, the contraction of striated muscle in the subumbrella is notably regulated by gap junctions, which electrically couple the muscle cells. The implant emulates this behavior by stimulating different neural circuitries, therefore modulating the escape response of the modified organism

Specimen was identified as DENIED, with a size of approximately 30 cm in diameter. The specimen was recovered by DENIED at DENIED, and was preserved in formaldehyde, exhibiting typical gelatinous structure. The jellyfish specimen displays the characteristic bell shape and translucent body typical of the species. The surface is smooth, with a slight iridescence under the laboratory lights. No visible lesions or abnormalities are noted on the exterior, aside from the presence of several small, metallic implants embedded within the mesoglea. There are three distinct implants observed, with a size ranging from DENIED to DENIED mm in length. Preliminary analysis suggests a composite material, possibly a blend of organic and synthetic substances. The implants exhibit a smooth, polished surface with intricate micro-patterns that appear to be engineered

Implant 1 is positioned near the center of the bell, adjacent to the gastrovascular cavity. Implant 2 is embedded within one of the radial canals. Implant 3 is located near the margin of the bell, close to the tentacles. Upon dissection, the internal anatomy of the jellyfish reveals the typical structures, including the gastrovascular cavity and the radial canals. The implants appear to be integrated into the jellyfish's biological systems, with some exhibiting signs of bio-integration, such as tissue growth around their edges. No signs of obstruction or damage caused by the implants. The cavity contains remnants of prey, consistent with the jellyfish's diet. The nerve net appears intact, but there are indications of unusual electrical activity in proximity to the implants, suggesting potential interaction between the jellyfish's biological systems and the foreign objects. The tentacles show no signs of damage, but there are unusual patterns of bioluminescence observed, possibly triggered by the implants

The presence of these unknown implants raises significant questions regarding their origin and purpose. Further analysis, including advanced imaging and material characterization, is required to determine their function and potential implications for the jellyfish's biology. The possibility of extraterrestrial technology or advanced bioengineering cannot be ruled out at this stage

ICO: The recent discovery of micro-sensors in the hadal zone has raised many questions. Can you share what your agency knows about their origin, and what specific features of these sensors have led you to believe they might be of extraterrestrial origin?
DOLYN-O: As you mentioned, the micro-sensors were discovered at extreme depths, which makes their presence quite unusual. Our preliminary analysis suggests that they exhibit technological characteristics that are not consistent with any known terrestrial technology. The sensors are incredibly small, on the order of micrometers with some of them measuring nanometers. They possess advanced capabilities for data collection and transmission that we have not yet been able to replicate. Additionally, the materials used in their construction show signs of being engineered in ways that defy our current understanding of material science.
ICO: Have there been any attempts to communicate with these sensors or to understand their purpose?
DOLYN-O: We are currently in the process of analyzing the data they have collected. There are indications that they are monitoring environmental conditions and possibly even biological activity in the hadal zone. However, we have not yet established any form of communication with them. The implications are significant. From a national security perspective, we need to understand who or what deployed these sensors and why. This could represent a new frontier in surveillance technology, whether it is from an extraterrestrial source or a highly advanced human entity.
ICO: What do you mean by 'a highly advanced human entity'?
DOLYN-O: No comment.
ICO: Are there any concerns about the potential risks associated with these sensors?
DOLYN-O: We are taking a cautious approach. There are concerns about the sensors' capabilities and whether they could be used for purposes beyond mere observation. We are working closely with various scientific and military experts from SV17q to assess any potential threats

The document should be redacted removing any statement about the discovery of non-terrestrial technological sensors in the hadal zone. Any reference to DOLYN or our operations in the hadal zone should also be removed from the document. Finally, the word 'non-terrestrial' should be deleted

To conduct biological sampling and find new organisms in the water column of a poorly explored area is not unusual. Finding organisms clearly modified by sophisticated micro- and nanotechnology implants is obviously an unpleasant surprise. The simplest thing was for SV17q to recognize that they are organisms created within the DOLYN program without caring why or for what purpose a technology that escapes us has been developed. But from the very moment that SV17q has denied having anything to do with these modified organisms, the issue takes a very different turn

We cannot go to the meeting point with DP-2147 before 2045. We don't have the technology that will allow us to get there. And if they know about it, they may have chosen as a neutral rendezvous zone the hadal zone of our ocean. But it turns out that we also don't have the technology that would allow us to manufacture a remotely operated vehicle that would operate at those depths and also incorporate all the processing power required. Using modified life forms that allow contact is a logical strategy. The question now is not whether we are alone, but how many of us are there. Is there anyone else here on Earth trying to contact them behind our backs? Who are them? That is the question
