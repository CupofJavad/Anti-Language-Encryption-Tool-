the language of a dream is different from awake language and therefore harder to remember

One of the chief functions of dreaming is to provide an opportunity for the dreamer
to gain practice in exercising the relevant physical, intellectual and
social skills. So, there is every reason to push forward research on synthdreams

Pleistocene minds contained simulations of threat perception and rehearsals of threat avoidance responses
and behaviors. But nowdays threats are of a different nature and those simulations are not valid anymore. 
We need to work today's human mind with new and realistic threats if we wish dreams to play the role 
they are supposed to play

What XViS adds to our understanding is the idea of searching for solutions in the dreamspace and this is 
what is of importance for survival
