Given that we have no access to an ELS other than by observation, it was classically proposed to use LyAV Supercomputer to perform some goal recognition analysis, that is, to determine an orb's intent by observing its behaviour under the different situations in which we have data (radar and direct observational data). A set 25 well documented UFO sightings ranging from 2007 to 2020 (which included the Yulara NTT Event) was then fed to the system

There were only two keyhole events (2%), that is, situations in which the ELS behaved just as if they were not being watched, while 30% of the events were classified as intended behaviour (in which the orbs actively attempted to reveal their goal), and 68% adversarial events (where the orb deliberately misleads or obfuscates)

The intuition underlying cost-based goal recognition rests on the assumption of rationality: the more closely an orb is following an optimal plan to sound and probe a given terrestrial target, the more likely it is that the target is its intended objective. However, ELS are a different type of non-terrestrial threat and rationality is not as clear-cut as it would be in a classical orb flyover or an orb landing problem. Though we can assume that the less rational a plan, the more expensive with respect to the real goal, the problem we face when analyzing non-terrestrial orbs and ELS is that ground truth is unknown. This explains why the results of our observations nearly always suggest UFO's are irrational (suboptimal) with respect to any particular goal, but again we are trying to understand a non-human system using human logic

The main limitation of any theoretical knowledge on ELS's, UAP's, or whatever name you happen to invent, is that it is always mediated; the deepest tragedy of any mediated knowledge is that it is mediated by human consciousness itself, and based on human logic in a way that renders that knowledge useless when it comes to understanding non-human intelligent systems

The success of the Yulara Event is due that, for the first time, we approached the analysis of the unknown not guided by the hypothetical-deductive, but the emotionally-psychological structures of consciousness
