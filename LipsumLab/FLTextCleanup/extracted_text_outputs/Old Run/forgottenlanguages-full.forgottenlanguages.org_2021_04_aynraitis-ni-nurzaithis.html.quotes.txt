Learn this: you should not hate sin so deeply that this hate may destroy you and your kind. You must find a way to destroy the sin and the appetite of sin without causing your own destruction. Engage yourself in fighting the sin by first learning what is sinful and what is not

Solitude is a great affliction; is that why you look for
other life forms out there in the dark space?
Your ship is your body, Norea.
But loneliness and solitude are two different things.
Loneliness means all doors are closed to you,
while solitude means even if the doors were wide open,
there is no one in those rooms

This I tell you:
that Life is a temporary loan,
and this world is nothing
but a sketchy imitation of Reality.
This I keep for myself:
that whenever you speak, good or evil,
it will come back to you

Norea, my child,
the whole universe is contained
within a single human being.
Kill one single human,
and you would have destroyed
an entire universe
