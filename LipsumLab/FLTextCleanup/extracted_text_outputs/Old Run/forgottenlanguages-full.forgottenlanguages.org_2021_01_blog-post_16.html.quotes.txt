How abundantly do spiritual beings display
the powers that belong to them! We look for,
but do not see
them; we listen for,
but do not hear them;
yet they enter into all things,
and there is nothing without them.
They cause all the people in the empire
to fast and purify themselves,
and array themselves in their richest
dresses,
in order to attend at their sacrifices.
Then, like overflowing water,
they seem to be over the heads,
and on the right and left,
of their worshippers
