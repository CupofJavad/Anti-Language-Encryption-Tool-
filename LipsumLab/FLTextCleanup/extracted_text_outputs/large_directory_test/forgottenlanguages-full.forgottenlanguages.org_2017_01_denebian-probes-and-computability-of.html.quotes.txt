Basic design principles dictate that they must deploy the probes close to a star if they wish to collect the required energy to get the massive computing core to work efficienty, and that the computing units must be protected from the star’s radiation and facing free space to maximize heat rejection

We believe that planets with strong gravitation and disturbing atmosphere are being avoided. This would explain the trajectory the first two probes detected followed once they entered Sol-3 system. However, the replication process requires to select either a moon or asteroid that is nevertheless large enough to provide all the building material for the replication process would be suitable. What we found on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is not, in our view, neither a Denebian probe nor a daughter probe. It must be a totally different object

Perhaps the initial idea of the owners of that object was to process resources on-site to produce further machine parts and, for some reason, the probe failed and entered a halt state. Or it may be that the probe reached the end of its operational life. Actually, there must be thousands of those objects on our moons and asteroids because obviously the exploration of galaxies based on probes is a project with diminishing return in the sense that the further the systems are away, the less important is a successful visit by the probe. Clearly, the number of scientific discoveries decreases with the number of investigated stellar systems and, on the other hand, the further the distance the probe travels, the longest the time needed to receive data collected

We are confident Quaoar will give us the answers we are looking for
