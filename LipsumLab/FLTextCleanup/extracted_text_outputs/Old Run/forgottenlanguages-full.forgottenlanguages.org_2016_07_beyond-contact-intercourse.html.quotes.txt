The only way for the intercourse between two radically different species to be successful is to locate one's center of consciousness in a spatial location separate from that of one's physical body. That's the conclusion of the XViS assessment report

An analytical study was conducted on the potential interaction between those beings and human individuals. The objective was to identify any undue sensitivities to that intercourse and recommend remedies where appropriate. The first step in this process was to build the facilities needed for the intercourse to take place. We thoroughly studied the penetration of diffused fields into the facility both analytically and experimentally, and we concluded there were no means to monitor what was happening inside the facility once the intercourse was taking place

Spacetime geometry is not fixed but variable quantum mechanically. Thus, the notion of 'state of consciousness' is the familiar idea of 'causality' in the sense that the entire four-dimensional spacetime geometry past, present, and future must be known to establish the decoherence if you wish to be able to predict the probabilities of alternatives in the present. Technically speaking, the intercourse takes place in our future, and their past

 the one who travels: it is your consciousness

, so we need to further investigate how to bring back the information gathered during the intercourse. We knew an encounter of the third kind with those beings won't be an easy task, and we knew the idea of communicating with beings with such a radically different nature was to be hard and nearly impossible. But we have to try everything at hand

 because naming the high strangeness we are exposed to is the last resort we have to not lose our minds and whatever makes of us humans

 that's the way you feel
