Incels are an extremist online community of men who believe in an ideology rooted in misogyny, racism, the glorification of violence, and dehumanization. They constitute a hotbed of misogyny, hegemonic masculinity, racism, self-hatred, and extremism. Incels believe society has unfairly shunned them. They feel entitled to sex, fetishize very young women, and believe that rape is justified. Incels share the worldview of radical muslims in relation to women

when belonging to an extremist group comes with incentives – material or psychological – that are tied to performing certain beliefs, people's genuine beliefs will often shift to match what they are required to express
