A school that teaches children to be afraid; a factory that enslaves, an all-controlling state that is designed to make you permanently afraid. To be afraid even of yourself, afraid even of who you vote for. Fear of whether it rains a lot or whether it rains a little; fear of dying from a cold; fear of calling a woman 'woman', or fear of waking up turned into an environmental terrorist, a sex offender, or a degenerate because some asshole thought of dictating a stupid law while you were sleeping
