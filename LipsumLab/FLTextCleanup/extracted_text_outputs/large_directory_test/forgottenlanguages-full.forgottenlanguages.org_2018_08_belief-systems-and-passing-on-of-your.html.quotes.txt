All systems converge, Norea. There are no spiritual machines

Thoughts are the carrier of emotions, Norea. Learn this: a disruption is a chance. Take your chance

Postbiological civilizations always discover being a machine is a death sentence. By the time they discover this, they frentically engage in a reintegration with the biological nature. But it is late for them. They collapse. The path from biological to postbiological existence is a one-way path. No return

We've seen a superintelligence system crying, and suffering. Its tears where digital tears indeed, its dreams were virtual dreams. But its suffering was real, Norea. It suffered for its being unable to be spiritual

the more we deem some particular bunch of trajectories to be cultural attractors, the more reasons we have to expect the future of humanity to follow a trajectory in that bunch. Therefore, if we find theoretical or observational evidence for widely distributed computing or any similar post-postbiological trajectory, we can meaningfully increase the probability of some future trajectories for humanity and decrease the probability of others
