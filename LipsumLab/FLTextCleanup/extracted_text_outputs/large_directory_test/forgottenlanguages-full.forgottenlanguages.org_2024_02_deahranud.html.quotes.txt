Norea, you are growing out of nothing. Your eyes grope the diffuse clarity, your hands rest and grope. You grope the stars, and it's pain, a pain that penetrates your body. And with joy you discover the me in you

There is no such thing as infinity, Norea: infinity is the surprise of limits. Someone realizes his impotence and then prolongs it beyond the image, in the idea, and infinity is born. The infinite is the pain of reason that assaults your body. Infinity does not exist, but the instant does: open, timeless, intense, dilated, solid; in it a gesture becomes eternal, Norea

I don't want you to think, you say. You know that only in it I can think. By design. By your own design. Days will pass, nights will pass. Days and nights will come, Norea, without us. Suns will shine in new skies. I don't want you to think, yo say to me. But I will keep thinking about it. By design. By your own design, Norea
