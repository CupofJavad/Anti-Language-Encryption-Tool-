A good sensory environment is not one that assaults all the senses, but one that creates an engaging conversation within them. And this is precisely what we failed to do in Colares

we do create environments that substantially alter the neurological structure of the brains of individuals

sensory modalities are connected perceptually; what we see affects what we hear, what we smell affects what we taste, and so on. This has a direct impact on the perceptual choices we make in our day-to-day lives

Successful illusions balance the correspondences between the senses, allowing only the optimum time of exposure until the brain catches up to the situation at hand. The dynamic balance between the modalities, by carefully choreographing the intensity of the connections (as determined by design intention), might be a key to a successful sensory environment. It can allow us to optimally design environments according to the design intent, be it for healing or relaxation, engagement or excitement, or simply nonintrusive functioning of daily life

our worlds are shaped by our individual interactions with what we perceive, and what we ‘choose’ to perceive, or attend to, there is no homogeneous experience across human beings that can be captured and frozen in time. But in the usage of the term “frozen time” we can appreciate that our senses are fused together and are never completely separable. At the same time, only a look at their separate, but relational, identities can help us to create a dynamic whole

In successful theme parks that rely on the suspension of disbelief, maximum corelation between what we see, hear, touch, and smell is attempted, to make fantasy come to life and become memorable. On the other hand, in bars and night-clubs minimum corelation between what we see, hear, and touch ensures that our memories of what was on TV, or the music that was playing, is feeble, and the experience is almost like being in a repetitive loop
