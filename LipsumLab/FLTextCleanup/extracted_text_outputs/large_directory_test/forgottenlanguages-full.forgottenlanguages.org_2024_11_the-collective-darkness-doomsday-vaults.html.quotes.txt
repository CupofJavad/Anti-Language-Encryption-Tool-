You may be thousands of years from the savannah and saber tooth tiger, but something might still eat you. Get ready

At the core was the complete defeat of critical thinking. We lost control of ourselves and of the situation

Human species has survived volcanic eruptions, meteoric impacts, and other natural hazards for tens of thousands of years. It seems unlikely that any of these old risks should exterminate humans in the near future. By contrast, human civilization is introducing many novel phenomena into the world, ranging from nuclear weapons to designer pathogens. There are many possible global catastrophes that would cause immense worldwide damage, maybe even the collapse of modern civilization, yet fall short of terminating the human species. The doomsday vaults network addresses the really terminal scenario: an species-extinction event

By year DENIED Sol-3 had a population greater than 1 trillion persons, life expectancy was greater than 500 years, a large fraction of the population had cognitive capacities more than two standard deviations above the 2075 human maximum, the majority of individuals had near-complete control over the sensory input, and human psychological suffering became a rare occurrence. To all effects they were not humans anymore. They were so close to reach the point of creating a hive mind that the decision was taken to terminate the species and to revert it to a human condition. That is the point in which we had to use the doomsday vaults and start over the terraforming of Sol-3

There are three beacons, located in three different planets. They use neutrinos and gravitational waves as signals. The beacons are designed to aim an almost infinitively sharp beam at a target over thousands of light years with accuracy. They signal the places where you can find the doomsday vaults. The rest is up to you

Unlike electromagnetic signals, which can be absorbed or scattered by planetary atmospheres and interstellar dust, neutrinos can traverse these obstacles with relative ease. This unique property positions neutrino-based beacons as a potential solution for signaling the locations of doomsday vaults, even from the depths of remote planets where traditional communication methods would fail

Each doomsday vault encompasses a comprehensive collection of genetic material, including DNA samples from a wide array of species, microorganisms, and even cryogenically preserved living organisms. Recall that the main goal is to create a repository that could be used to restore ecosystems in the event of catastrophic extinction-level events

Planets hosting the beacons are chosen for their stability, lack of geological activity, and minimal risk of human interference. The moons of gas giants, such as Europa or Enceladus, with their subsurface oceans, are a logical choice because they provide suitable environments for vaults. Additional reasons make Ganymede a better candidate, though. The existence of a potential beacon site candidate in Alpha Mensae-4 implies planets in the habitable zone of distant stars might also serve as potential sites. The challenge lies not only in the construction of these vaults but also in ensuring that they remain undisturbed and accessible for future retrieval

The beacon emits a steady stream of neutrinos that are modulated with the intent to convey information about the vaults' locations and the nature of the ecosystems they contain. Once generated, the neutrinos are emitted in a focused beam, directed toward the cosmos. In addition to their primary function of signaling vault locations, these neutrino beacons are also designed to provide ongoing updates about the status of the ecosystems they protect. Modulating a neutrino beam is beyond our current technological level

Obviously, an artificial source of stable neutrinos that could last for millennia involves a sophisticated combination of nuclear physics, advanced engineering, and innovative design, but its design is clearly at the technological level of a civilization 200 years ahead of ours. Theoretically, using long-lived isotopes, a closed-loop recycling system, and robust containment structures, it is conceivable to create a neutrino source that continuously emits neutrinos over extended periods

On August 5, 2011, NASA’s Juno spacecraft embarked on a 5-year journey to Jupiter. Juno made its flyby of Ganymede on June 7, 2021, 17:35 UTC, coming within 1,038 km, the closest any spacecraft has come to the moon. Ganymede is tidally locked, meaning that like Earth’s Moon, the same side of Ganymede always faces Jupiter. Ganymede has three main layers: A metallic iron core at its center, a spherical shell of rock (mantle) surrounding the core, and a spherical shell of mostly ice surrounding the rock shell. The surface is the very top of the ice shell. Average temperature at the point of interest is estimated at -247 degrees ﻿Celsius

Project Eden-2 is not totally a terraforming project. I mean, you don't need to create oceans for Earth. There is no need to melt polar icecaps, but we envisage the spreading of a thin layer of soot across the icecaps so they absorb the sun's heat to create an atmosphere of water, carbon dioxide, and other gases. We expect future Earth to have an atmosphere that will almost certainly be extremely poisonous for humans. But the main idea of the doomsday vault is to use it for the introduction of genetically engineered organisms whose life chemistry would free gases existing in common compounds on the future Earth surface. Once an atmosphere exists we could modify it using genetically engineered microorganisms designed to convert existing gases and compounds into oxygen, carbon dioxide and water. Over time and with extensive human intervention this program might create a pre-extinction Earth-like and hopefully breathable atmosphere. Throughout this process, we will need to adjust the planet's surface temperature. Once conditions were suitable, we would introduce plants and animals which could survive in the existing conditions and eventually we would create working ecosystems which in turn could support human life. The whole process is supposed to take a number of centuries, but at the end of that period there would supposedly be a new garden of Eden

Doomsday vaults can be recovered by any intelligent species which happens to decode the beacon's signal. The analysis of its contents will provide all the required data to figure out the organisms that would emerge once seeded. But bear in mind that revivification of species is a dangerous business that would equate reviving, say, a mamooth today

Terraforming involves us in a sin: the sin of hubris. Hubris is a vice which is popularly thought to involve excessive pride before the gods. It occurs when humans willfully ignore their limits and seek to become like gods. Hubris is traditionally punished by disaster. The excess of pride is the undoing of those who possess it and they are put in their place, usually roughly. That's clearly what happens to humans, so it would be logical to not include any human genome in the doomsday vault

Terraforming is not just another project. It is a project that would make us world makers. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a secure backup facility for the world's crop diversity located on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen. We are here talking about a country that has a huge share in the destruction of the planet due to its oil industry, not to talk about Norway's share in the global inequality through the Government Pension Fund. The main goal is to provide security of the world's food supply against the loss of seeds in genebanks due to mismanagement, accident, equipment failures, funding cuts, war, sabotage, disease, and natural disasters. The whole project spells hubris. Those seeds will be unable to grow or survive in a post-extinction environment, unless you carry out terraforming activities before re-introducing the seeds
