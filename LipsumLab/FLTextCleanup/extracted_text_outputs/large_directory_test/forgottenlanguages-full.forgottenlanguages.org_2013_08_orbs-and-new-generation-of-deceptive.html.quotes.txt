A large ball, like lightning, would have a bright silvery-metallic appearance by day, and shine brightly by night. Irregularities in the field could produce light or dark spots on a ball; the color could vary, depending on the effective surface temperature. A row of evenly spaced lights might arise from a circular form of bead lightning, which probably consists of a standing longitudinal electric current wave. Intense heat, light and ultraviolet light would be radiated, as well as possibly radio interference or microwaves


Free energy devices and electron-muon decay levitation is proposed



Electromagnetically-Induced Transparency (EIT) may be defined as the reduction (or ideally, elimination) of resonant absorption, or enhancement of transmission, of a probe (also called signal) EM field in an otherwise opaque medium, via the prior application of a suitably intense, suitably-tuned, suitably-enveloped pump (or drive, or control) EM field
