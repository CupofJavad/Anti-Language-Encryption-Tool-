While the challenge of finding the core
function of human and animal sleep remains unknown when tested under the null
hypothesis, studies on the neural correlates of consciousness during meditation
have revealed neuroplasticity effects. The synchrony of gamma brain oscillations
reflecting various styles of meditation or attention, also known as the binding
problem, may be related to conscious experiences. This binding problem with
gamma brain oscillatory synchronization also arises in relation to sensory awareness
or perception, affecting the perception of time and hallucinatory experiences
in various disorders of consciousness such as severe schizophrenic and déjà vu
(in healthy or epileptic) patients

Near Death Experiences can be induced in a controlled way to generate 
a special state of consciousness allowing us to access the unconscious and 
subconscious level which, in turn, allow us to perform dream content analysis 
and introduce the needed corrections into the system. Conscious states are influenced by the
biochemical and biophysical substrates of wakefulness, sleep and dreaming, thus by 
modifying in real-time those substrates we virtually control sleep and dreaming

Analyzing precognitive dreams tells you a lot about altered states of consciousness 
because the dream experiences tap into the unconscious states. 
No need to use drugs, just a manipulation of brain waves in both the space and time 
domains is all we need

The human perception of time is linked to experience and how that
perception can be altered. The transitions between the waking and other special states
of consciousness, such as NDE, sleep, dream, daydreaming, mind-wandering,
trance, dissociation, meditation and hypnosis, offer an explanation for various
extraordinary elements that humans report, of which visions and prognostic dreams 
are the main focus of the XViS project

In the long run, transfering and storing consciousness is what we need to escape 
the physical experience. Clearly, our physical body is designed to allow us to 
interact with our terrestrial environment, yet our planet is just one of the myriad 
environments that exist in the Universe. We do not need to travel to other star systems 
or galaxies; what we really need is our consciousness to travel, at the speed of light, to distant 
points in the Universe. And believe me, it is much easier to get our consciousness to travel 
than buiilding a starship to get us to another star
