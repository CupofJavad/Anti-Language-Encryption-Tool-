You are responsible to deploy core information sharing architectures to enable all relevant services to meet mission critical information sharing, domain awareness, and multi-agency operational coordination needs. That's what your contract says. Your office was assigned a budget with the goal to identify and counter emerging and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats, among other tasks, such as countering transnational criminal organizations and other illicit actors. You were also tasked with supporting the cybersecurity of federal civilian networks, whatever they are, and with strengthening the security and resilience of critical infrastructure, plus assessing and countering evolving cyber and emerging technology risks, and to combat cybercrime. And you are supposed to meet those goals while ensuring you do not diminish privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties of persons. And what's all we've got? Plans, meetings, roadmaps, planning assessments, and a lot of boring dossiers, documents, and agendas. Get this right, general: we are a nation, and our only business is to destabilize other nations, exploit their natural resources, and make our citizens feel threatened so that we can continue to control them. That is our business. Nation-states are just variables in our equations, elements within the system. States are used by class forces to pursue their interest. National security is all about the security of the ruler class

I see. So you propose to use QuSecure’s QuProtect, the industry’s first end-to-end PQC software-based solution uniquely designed to protect encrypted communications and data with quantum-resilience using quantum secure channels. This is what your brochure states. As for you, your company is devoted to build computing chips, software and cryptographic algorithms. You are developing VPUs, custom silicon chips that use an instruction set architecture specific to cryptography, thus allowing to break down any cryptographic algorithm into its mathematical building blocks that are natively accelerated and supported by the chip. However, you don't seem to care what data and information we are going to encrypt and protect. Or maybe you already know that the data we are going to encrypt is about you, which makes of you a stupid slave, don’t you think?

Sir, in your presentation you stated your company develops algorithms that are built to allow us planners to immediately respond to disruptions. What if the disruption was you and your family - have you thought about that? Stupidity and hate do not require philosophical consistency, only an operational effectiveness that performs their ideological theatre of cruelty

We need to civilize our civilizations. We cannot afford the hope that a new war will lead to a new revolution: a new war would much more probably mean the end of civilization as we know it, with the survivors organized in small authoritarian groups. Groups that will eventually die of hunger, thirst, and, above all, they'll die being stupid. Your civilization is just the dumb blonde

The objective of intellectual activity is to create knowledge that uncovers hidden structures and allows oneself to act upon the world and change it. We constantly analyze data looking for patterns, cycles, regularities, and structures that would allow us to unveil the connections among networks of subnetworks in a changing world. All the links we discover are links about hegemony

The pursuit of sustained growth with price stability may not guarantee a balance of payments position that does not have disruptive effects on exchange rates; domestic and external stability cannot preclude threats to global stability. Neither can global stability assure domestic/external stability at the individual country level. And if you don't understand this you don't understand the world you live in

The virtualization of the emotional life is converging to create a level of loneliness and despair that is difficult to consciously refuse and oppose. At the end of the day, that was what we wanted because that was the magic solution that allowed us to control entire societies and an entire planet
