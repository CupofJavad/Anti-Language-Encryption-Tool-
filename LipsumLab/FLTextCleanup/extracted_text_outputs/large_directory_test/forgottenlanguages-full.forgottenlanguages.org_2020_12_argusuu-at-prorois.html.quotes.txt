The belief in a Great Designer of the Universe, a design so minutely and thoroughly crafted for life to emerge, leads to a paradox.
An intelligent designer could not have been that intelligent. If  it had, it would have loosened up on the conditions necessary for life so that  they weren't so stringent. Such conditions for life reduce the chances of life  rather than necessitate it. A change of a few degrees in temperature can decide  the existence or not of life. An intelligent designer would have made conditions more flexible ensuring greater survival conditions for life

Either there is no Great Designer of the Cosmos, or he is certainly a bad engineer, or perhaps there were two engineers: one who created the Universe, without life, and a second one who was able to create life despite the hard conditions for life to emerge

Whilst human beings create complex products it does not follow that a designing intelligence is required to create the universe. Intelligent design theory is therefore false, unless part of the intelligent design includes humans in order for them to destroy the Universe

explanations intended to answer one sort of question cannot be substituted for those that answer another
