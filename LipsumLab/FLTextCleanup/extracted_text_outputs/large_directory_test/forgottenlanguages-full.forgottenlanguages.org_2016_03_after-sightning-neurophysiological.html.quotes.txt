Although freeze/immobility states inmammals may be useful for short-term survival, prolongation or repeated activation of that state clearly has serious implications for health and long-term survival

Findings in testing the boundaries of a traumatized patient reveals that the area of a person’s perception where they first experienced the warning of the impending threat (eg – the approaching automobile) will thereafter be an area where accessing any stimulus is intrinsically threatening. As a result, passing a hand around the periphery of that person’s visual field at the distance of 3-4 feet will often produce an arousal response in the region of perception of prior threat. Such patients have developed a conditioned arousal reflex within areas of their perceptual surround, or boundary. Predictably, persistent ambient
subliminal sensory perceptual experiences
within that region, whether visual, tactile or proprioceptive in nature, will result in conditioned arousal and will perpetuate the kindled trauma reflex

It will come as no surprise, therefore, that many patients with localized signs of conversion will experience symptoms of discomfort and arousal with presentation of visual or other seemingly benign stimuli within those regions of their boundary perception that now possess the sensory perception of threat
