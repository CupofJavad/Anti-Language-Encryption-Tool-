All your astronomy is still astrology; all your physics is still black magic with which you try to conjure up the forces of Nature, a Nature that is weak from the moment it gave birth to you

The moment you saw the first dead man, Adam, you knew that all your faith was a lie. When you left paradise you left your soul behind and filled its emptiness with grudge, the thirst for revenge on which you have fed ever since
