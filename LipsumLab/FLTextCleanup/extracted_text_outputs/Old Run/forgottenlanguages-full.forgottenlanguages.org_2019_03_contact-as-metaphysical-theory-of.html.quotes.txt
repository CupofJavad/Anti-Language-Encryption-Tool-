Contact Theory is a prejudice theory, and we can thus add that it is a theory that seeks to eliminate hate prejudice

The human mind is a prejudiced mind, the tendency of which is to personify evil and thus lead to the failure of human solidarity towards a co-operative life

The problem here lies in the fact that we are not used to be the object of research; we have always been  the ones researching and observing phenomena and objects; for the first time, we are the ones being  studied, observed, and this causes anxiety and distress. It is not that our prejudices make us see  an alien probe as a threat, it is that we really cannot conceive we are under someone else's microscope.  This time we are the bacteria being researched, probed, and tested. We make all kind of efforts to  prove DP-2147 is just a planetary body, an asteroid or even a yet unknown cosmic phenomena, not  because we are good scientists, but because intimately we wish it to be something like that and not  an alien probe. The core of the matter is this: we are afraid of being contacted
