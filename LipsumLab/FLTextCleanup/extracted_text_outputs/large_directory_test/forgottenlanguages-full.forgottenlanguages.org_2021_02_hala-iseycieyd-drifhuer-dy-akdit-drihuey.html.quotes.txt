Future and possible states are accessed to create events in the present. The understanding that acts of mind are possible states interactions exactly like physical acts, may prove to be the most liberating of concepts

Consciousness is not limited to human beings, or even to biological life forms. It is an emergent property of complex systems which interact inside a cosmic reality composed of information

There is no difference between this reality and a dream of this reality because there is no experiment that could reliably distinguish between them. Our dreamers always end at the fence separating the river from the rice field, and the moment they try to video tape the rice field a drone appears and the dreamers are awaken, vanishing the entire vision

for human beings reality can be considered to hinge on human decisions and intentions; for Giselians reality hinges on their decisions and intentions. But there is a twlight zone in which both realities meet and mix up. We are as amazed of seeing them as they are of seeing us

Everything that can happen does, and it all happens at once. We inhabit a permanent now, a complex present in which the past, the future and the possible coincide and interact

I consider the Armadillo Transect event as the clearest evidence on the existence of non-terrestrial intelligence
