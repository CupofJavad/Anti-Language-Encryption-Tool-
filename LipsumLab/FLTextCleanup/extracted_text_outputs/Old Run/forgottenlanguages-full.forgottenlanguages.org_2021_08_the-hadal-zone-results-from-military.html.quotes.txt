Revisiting the DENIED sector of the hadal zone resulted in enigmatic and worrying surprises. DENIED sector has been used as a dumping ground for both highly toxic pharmaceutical and radioactive waste materials. When DENIED sector was chosen as a dumping area the decision was mainly driven by the anthropocentric opinion of ‘out of sight, out of mind’. After 38 years of use, the decision was made to revisit the sector in order to perform biosampling and to study the impact of wastes on the abyssal and hadal hydroids

It is startling how little is known about the hadal environment, a lack of knowledge that renders a limited view of the communities that survive at the greatest depths and endure the highest pressures on Earth. Finding intelligent organisms was a shock, indeed. But finding that those organisms evolved from the yet unknown action of our radioactive and pharmacological wastes was a total shock

HxVDP, the Hadal Exploration Vehicle Design Program, is a series of military projects that have been running from 2001 to the present. The main goals of the program is the design of both manned and unmanned hadal exploration vehicles for biosampling, mapping of the deep ocean trenches, and support to the deep ocean tier of the DOLYN program

HxVDP-11.2A design follows that of PSV Tangent. The vehicle is meant to patrol the deep ocanic areas, mainly the abyssal plains, though it is specifically suited to explore the hadal zone. You see, the hadal zone consists of extremely deep trenches, located at tectonic plate boundaries. Exploring this zone poses extreme technical challenges in the form of extremely high hydrostatic pressure. Bear in mind that sampling equipment has to be capable of withstanding over 1 ton of pressure per square centimetre in order to resist implosion. Those are places where you should hide whatever you wish to remain hidden. The hadal zone would make for the best place to deploy neutrino-emitting terminal beacons, were it not because it is an extremely active geological area. Exploring that area was what HxVDP-11.2A was doing when the high strangeness incident occured

The basic mission profile consists of lowering HxVDP-11.2A to the desired start depth; once there, the vehicle releases the hadal lander which hauls vertically to the desired end depth. The hadal lander is fitted with equipment specifically designed to collect the fauna and material in sediments, and can gently insert each push core tube into the sediment creating very little disturbance. Neutrino beacons are inserted this way before final sealing. The lander payload comprises several charge-coupled device (CCD) and wide-angle video and stills cameras, multiple high-intensity lights and other sensors, such as a scanning sonar, altimeter, compass and pressure sensors

Sample DENIED was capture at a depth of 6,700 m. The sample included several specimens of unknown species. It was shown that these biomorphs in particular herald impressive decompression tolerances. Except for sample DENIED, all other samples recovered from hadal depths at Sector DENIED died upon reaching atmospheric pressure and this was verified by a lack of observable activity after recompression

The inertization process consists in wrapping DENIED lethal viruses with an organic osmolyte that provides high pressure resistance. Cylinders filled with these highly dangerous inert viruses are then deposited in the waste area in Sector DENIED, at a depth of 7,200 meters below sea level. The previous biosampling programs showed that only some bivalves, gastropods, and holthurians were present at the moment of the disposal of the pharmacological wastes. The target area is geologically quiet

The mission's goal was revisiting Sector DENIED in order to examine whether the security cylinders filled with radiological and pharmacological wastes were in place, and to review the physical conditions of the confinement seals. Apart from input of gelatinous zooplankton carcasses covering cylinders number 2, 3, and 4, nothing abnormal was found

authorization to retrieve cylinders 1 and 5 was denied on the basis of the extreme danger that the accidental release of the contents could pose for both the environment and human life; instead, it was approved to use the hadal lander robotic arm to sample the external biofilm that covered the surface of both cylinders for further in-labo analysis

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence data we are to conclude the bacteria in the biofilm are unrelated to any other life form on Earth for which relevant data exist. The identification of sample 337 with Psychromonas hadalis K41G is also rejected, leading us to conclude this sample is unknown to us

The unknown object did also contained wastes of some sort we couldn't identify. Strain DENIED exhibited few differences in the growth characteristics under varying pressure conditions and thus represents a convenient deep-sea new bacterium for research focused on high-pressure adaptations

All of the organisms sampled at 7,185 m in the Kermadec Trench were massively infected, making us to conclude either a leak in cylinders 1 and 5 caused the pharmacological waste to keep in touch with hadal biota producing all kind of genomic anomalies, or either the radiological waste caused mutations in their genome, or perhaps a fatal combination of high pressure, darkness, low temperature, radiation, and exposure to biological agents from the waste caused the anomalies detected. We are still reluctant to accept the incident caused the appearance of the new life forms sampled by the hadal lander at DENIED Sector

Unless we have clear and fully justified reasons to research on the biotechnological potential of these new life forms, we recommend to put on hold the retrieval and surface storage of material contaminated with these biomorphs, as all experimental data gathered in experiments carried out with them prove they are highly dangerous for terrestrial life. Though we are aware of the novel biocompounds of potential importance in medicine and biotechnology, it is the recommendation of this Committee to put on hold all military and civilian sampling campaigns on the deep ocean trenches, with a strict ban of operations in the DENIED Sector of the hadal zone
