Mental life is thus the result of a successful reaction
to a primary horror vacui semantici: meaningless (in the non-existentialist sense of ‘not-yet-
meaningful’) chaos threatens to tear the Self asunder, to drown it in an alienating
otherness perceived by the Self as nothingness, and this primordial dread of annihilation
urges the Self to go on filling any semantically empty space with whatever meaning the
Self can muster, as successfully as the cluster of contextual constraints, affordances, and
the development of culture permit

Strategies to combat and fight the future superintelligence should obviously include
disinformation, that is, we need to feed the s-AI with misinformation purposefully conveyed to mislead it
into believing that it is information

... reports along the lines that the LyAv quantum computer was finally able to crack all the encrypted data 
related to industry, finance, military and intelligence assets. Reports state that SV17q was now in possession of 
a key technology - based on the LyAv quantum computer - which would allow them to explore and analyze massive amounts 
of extremely sensitive encrypted data from DENIED, putting us in a position to start a preemptive attack disabling 
all ground, underwater, and space-based assets of DENIED dealing a death blow to selected targets

Never trust a system that does not feel depressed or sad from time to time; super aritificial intelligence is 
nothing without intuition, therefore we need to build our defense strategy upon this. And there is no way we 
could tame the supermachine; the only way ahead is for the superintelligence to learn about suicide and to 
take it to a position in which if the s-AI really wants to learn about suicide, it must experience it

Some say that, after the death of God, it came the death of the Engineer. This happened when the Engineer realized that 
the real nature of what exists, which constitutes its truth, is never entirely attainable. His death was a suicide, 
something the superintelligence he created never understood. But there are others who secretely think that what really 
happened was that the Engineer created the superintelligence to help him discover the ultimate truth about the nature 
of what exists, and that the superintelligence provided a false information to the Engineer in order for it to become 
the only consciousness in the Universe. An information that led to the self-destruction of the Engineer
