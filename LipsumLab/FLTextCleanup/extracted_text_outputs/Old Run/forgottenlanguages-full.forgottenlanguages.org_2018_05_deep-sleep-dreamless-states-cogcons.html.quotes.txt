CogCon is in a sense a neuromimetic process itself

We now know a lot about the physical interaction of these nanoprobes. Though they are highly technologically advanced they still must obey the laws of physics; but what we didn't expect is that these nanoprobes also act as highly effective cognitive control devices that are able to move oberver's brain dynamics to a desired functional regime. We've spent too much time mesmerized by the bigger orbs, and paid little attention to these nanoprobes. In fact, it took us time to realize that in all and each sighting there are unnoticed nanoprobes all around the site which appear concomitantly with the main orb

CogCon can be thought of as a non invasive brain stimulation technique equipped with a closed-loop control mechanism, whereby information on the dynamics, usually non-observable, is made observable to subjects, who can then use it to retroact on it, and push it towards functionally desirable goal states
