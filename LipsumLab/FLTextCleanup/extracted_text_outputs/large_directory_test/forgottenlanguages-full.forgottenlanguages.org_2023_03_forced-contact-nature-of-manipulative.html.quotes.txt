Human society has failed to produce on-going social progress in these areas because it does not include a mechanism that selects and reproduces social improvements when they are discovered or proposed. If society stumbles on improvements either by accident or by conscious effort, there is no process that locks in the improvements and perpetuates them. The economic and political markets that select and reproduce technological advances do not do the same for social improvements

social progress is as inevitable, unstoppable and natural as technological progress

Everything is the product of an immense network of cooperation, including your extinction. So, why is contact a must? Because combinations of living things can also do things that individuals cannot. The ability to form larger-scale cooperative groups enables organisms to manage and manipulate their environment over larger scales

A human social system organised on the scale of the planet is likely to be able to develop the capacity to prevent large asteroids from colliding with the planet. Intelligent societies organised on galactic scales are likely to escape the Great Filter. If only for that reason, cooperation is a must

What has you learned about evolutionary game theory? It is indeed a powerful approach to study the problem of cooperation in various biological, social and economic settings, sure, but what has you learned when applied to contacting non-terrestrial civilizations? You've learned that cooperation flourishes under a variety of mechanisms, including kin selection, group selection, and reciprocity. And you've learned that interactions among different civilizations are not random, but often exquisitely structured. Contact has a purpose beyond mere curiosity. You are both destined to cooperate, even if you feel a deep mutual dislike for each other. And the choice is as clear as a thousand suns: either you cooperate, or you become extinct. In other words, you have no alternative
