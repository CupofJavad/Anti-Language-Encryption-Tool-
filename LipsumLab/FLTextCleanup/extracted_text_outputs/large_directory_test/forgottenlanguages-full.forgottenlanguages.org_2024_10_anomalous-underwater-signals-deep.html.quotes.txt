It is not as if suddenly, the sonar operator detects an unusual signal, an object emitting a series of rhythmic pulses, unlike anything we have encountered before. It's not like that. What happens i that, for unknown reasons, we all get that uncanny feeling that something weird is about to happen. This feeling appears, say, three or two days before the incident. Don't ask me why, but that's how it goes

The captain ordered the submarine to approach cautiously, deploying drones equipped with high-resolution cameras and sensors to gather more information. In this particular event we deployed DENIED UUVs, and we even requested support for the nearest PSV at the time. As the drones descended, they captured images of a massive, sleek, metallic structure that appeared to be partially embedded in the trench's sediment. I remember its smooth and reflective surface. There were no visible seams or markings, but at this point the video signal was blurry

The real-time feed is analyzed by the signal analysis AI onboard, with the help of the DOLYN operators. The DOLYN AI suggested a cautious approach, recommending to establish communication through light signals, mirroring the object's pulsating patterns

Yes, it was a groundbreaking encounter. You can see it like that, I guess. It was, until the object emitted a low-frequency hum that made us experience an unexpected and dangerous turbulence. We all thought it was time to pack and go. Yet we received order to continue to engage with the unidentified submerged object. That's when the groundbreaking encounter turned into a hellish experience

It is a neural network architecture for the recognition and classification of underwater acoustic signals, which greatly improved the classification accuracy. In practical situations, datasets are not readily available due to some limitations and security reasons. Therefore, when adding classification labels to actual applications for in-depth analysis of weak signals related to DENIED USOs and finding details, there may be no large datasets for training

The report stated that at 14:25 UTC, the crew deployed a UUV drone, as per the CO, equipped with high-resolution cameras to investigate the source of the signals. The drone transmitted live video feed back to the OBCC room. The UUV footage revealed a large, metallic object approximately DENIED meters in length, with a smooth, reflective surface. The object emitted a series of blue and green lights that pulsed in sync with the sonar signals, as per the ST statement

They report the object began to exhibit rapid, erratic movements, changing direction and depth with unknown speed. The UUV was by then at a distance of DENIED meters from the object. A Communication Attempt was initiated, as per the CO, at 14:28 UTC. The ET specialist was instructed to command the UUV to emit a series of light signals. DENIED recordings and DENIED logs shows DENIED activity in the vicinity of the object. The object responded by altering its light patterns, suggesting a possible attempt at communication

At 14:30 UTC, the object abruptly changed course and descended deeper into the trench, disappearing from the UUV's range. The USS DENIED maintained a safe distance and continued monitoring the area for any further activity

The location was approximately DENIED nautical miles from the coast of DENIED, at a depth of DENIED feet. USS DENIED was performing routine sonar surveillance operations at the moment. At 10:17 UTC, the sonar system began to register unusual signals characterized by a series of low-frequency pulses interspersed with high-frequency chirps. The signals were recorded and were provided by the ST. The signals were persistent and exhibited a rhythmic pattern. The signals were in the frequency range of DENIED Hz to DENIED kHz, each pulse lasting DENIED seconds, followed by a 3-second interval. As per the DOLYN analysis, the signals displayed a unique modulation pattern that does not match any known marine mammal vocalizations or typical underwater geological activity, confirming the initial ST automatic analysis by the onboard sonar processing software, in the sense that they do not correspond to any recorded marine mammal species, including cetaceans and pinnipeds

... supporting the initial conclusion that the signals originated from a non-biological source..

When we detect a signal, we want to know whether the source is geological, animal or man-made. That is our mission. And if it is man-made, we want to know where it came from. The worst thing that can happen is that the algorithm classifies the signal as 'unknown', because that requires us to answer uncomfortable questions. So when we encounter anomalous signals, we tend to classify them as 'animal source' or 'geological source'. You will never see a log or a signal analysis report that says 'USO', let alone 'non-human intelligence'. But let me insist on this, the government position is that UAP clearly pose a safety of flight issue and may pose a challenge to national security. See? Nothing is said about USOs

the proposal which recommends to share findings with naval intelligence and DENIED to perform further analysis and potential identification of the signal source, was dismissed by SV17q, which further instructed CO to delete all sonar data and observations related to the anomalous signals once relayed to the DOLYN network

There is no cover-up of incidents involving undersea unidentified objects. There is just a non-disclosure in the sense that giving away information would mean disclosing our sub was at a particular position, at a particular time, and that it deployed this and that UUV, fitted with this and that high-resolution sensor. And if I give you positional, spatial, temporal, and technical details, I'd be revealing mission-critical data to our enemies. See, USOs are of zero interest to us; actually, they are a fucking damn annoyance. Our sole objective is to detect any object in the water at any time, determine if it is a threat or not, identify it, and profile it. Nothing else. Whether they are human or not is not our concern

DOLYN incorporates combined nonlinear dynamical reconstruction techniques, radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, stochastic resonance, and an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for performing weak underwater signals analysis. The underwater environment is very complex because of natural and human activities. Wind and waves on the sea surface, marine biological activities, ocean currents on the seabed and the movement of hulls all contribute to a noisy environment. In addition, some underwater targets can change their frequencies and other information to hide themselves

Our most advanced sub can reach depths of around 1,000 meters, while the hadal zone in the area where the USO was detected has depths around 6,000 meters, which means we need to deploy tethered UUVs, and at least 3 relay beacons to have an opportunity to receive the signals optimally. Anyway, military submarines are highly advanced, but they are not built for the extreme conditions found in the hadal zone. The Hadal zone is a no-go area for us
