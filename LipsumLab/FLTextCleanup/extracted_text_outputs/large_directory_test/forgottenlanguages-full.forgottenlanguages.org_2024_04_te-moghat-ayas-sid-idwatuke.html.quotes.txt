Something is there in darkness. I know this, and this is a healing self-knowledge. Something is there in darkness, a whisper of secrets shrouded in shadows. The truth of the unknown lies deep within, at the bottom of the obsidian abyss. Step fearlessly into the darkness, and you'll fall. Retreat, and you'll miss the hidden truths that dwell in the darkness

Ethereal lights dance in the darkness, glowing softly. Look at them as you die. Isn't that a mesmerizing sight? Now feel the cold caresses from a gentle breeze, and hear the whispers of magic as your soul fades away. Have a last look around you, as the lights flicker without a care
