Superstitions are typically seen as inconsequential creations of irrational minds. Nevertheless, many people rely on superstitious thoughts and practices in their daily routines in order to gain good luck. To date, little is known about the consequences and potential benefits of such superstitions. This behavior also affects scientists; actually, scientists are on average more prone to superstitious beliefs than non-scientists. Surprisingly, there are performance benefits of superstitions. and therefore it is required to fully investigate the underlying psychological mechanisms on which superstition is based



Science created by irrational beings is just human attempt to systematically generate knowledge, resulting in nothing more than having one’s fortune told from the coffee cup; within that science, any arbitrary and unconstrained interpretation seems possible

Superstition occurs when the cognitive system tries to find sense in the flood of incoming data. In humans this search for new rules may be accompanied by a feeling of anxiety. However the chances are that the newly constructed rule is nothing but a bad guess

If there is a universal truth about superstition, it is that superstitious behavior emerges as a response to uncertainty, to circumstances that are inherently random and uncontrollable. If, as per quantum mechanics, the world is inherently random and uncontrollable, then you should expect all observers to be superstitious

Face it: superstitious behavior is an inevitable feature of adaptive behavior in all organisms, including humans
