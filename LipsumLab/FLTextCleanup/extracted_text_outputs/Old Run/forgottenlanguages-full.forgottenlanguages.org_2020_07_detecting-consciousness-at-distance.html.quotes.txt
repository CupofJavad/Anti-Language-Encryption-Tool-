But the most promising idea is based on the accumulated evidence concerning consciousness-related 
anomalies in physical systems in which small but consistent intentional influences upon remote random 
mechanical and random electronic devices have been observed. Once we replaced these mechanical systems 
by quantum ones - like the one known as quantum pendulum - we were able to design a device that 
could detect the presence of consciousness at a distance. This device is the one on which the 
DENIED system of swarm probes is based. Once positioned around DP-2147, the probes consistently registered 
the signal patterns we predicted for the presence of consciousness, so yes, we are convinced DP-2147 
is manned or, at least, it is a conscious intelligence somehow

Forget about receiving a signal with encoded information coming from a planet orbiting a 
faraway planet; forget about exchanging signals with an extraterrestrial spaceship. It is not
going to be like that. Under various conditions people involved in close encounters with 
UFOs  report experiences in which the temporal ordering of the elements in their
consciousness, or the temporal relation of those elements
to concurrent activity in their brains, seems to be anomalous
or even paradoxical. Now, is this due to the existence of an immaterial
mind that interacts with the brain in physically inexplicable fashion? In our view, communicating 
with a distant spaceship must be done using consciousness-related communications, not using 
radio signals. Our deep-space comms network is simply not fitted for interstellar communications

We are very interested in these phenomena, not because we are genuinely interested in how 
consciousness works, rather because we are currently weaponizing quantum mechanics, you know, 
building quantum computers to guide our missiles, to command and control our space-based weapons, 
to control our cryptographic systems using quantum entanglement, and it would be very bad news for us 
to learn that a stupid chaman, a deranged guru, or any hippie high on drugs can finally mess up 
with our delicate systems by simply focusing their minds or whatever you call whatever they do with 
their brains

Detecting consciousness at a distance by measuring the anomalous behavior of a quantum pendulum 
in the presence of consciousness is key to gain further knowledge about DENIED, DENIED, and other 
unexpected liquid visitors, but it also opens the door to hack quantum computers. This is 
unacceptable to us for what concerns pur own quantum computers, but it is certainly required 
for us to be able to hack the Great Simulator's quantum computer creating the simulated reality 
in which we are kept jailed
