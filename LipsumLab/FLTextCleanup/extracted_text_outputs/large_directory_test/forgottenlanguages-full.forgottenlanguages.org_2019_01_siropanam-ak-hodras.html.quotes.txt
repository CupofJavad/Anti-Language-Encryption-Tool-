I acknowledge the Light of the one church in every place:
Interior, Invisible, Secret and Universal,
the foundation of the lights of the great living Nature.
I seek liberation of my perfection
from the corruptions of the world
and look to the gathering of the sparks of Light
from the sea of forgetfulness
