What is it that drives the evolution of human consciousness? The one-word answer is ‘necessity’

a system cannot be completely understood in terms of itself

The perception of time is coupled to dynamical processes often associated with entropic flow; but entropic time does not correlate with clock time. And clock time only correlates with psychological time for certain states of consciousness. If a process is harmonic or occurs at a microscopic level where the laws of physics are temporally symmetric all conception of time can be lost; thus the nature of time has maintained itself as a dilemma

Fully developed intelligence has no need for physical travel. A form of inter-dimensional superposition would be tantamount to providing an ontological presence invisible to us but not to them
