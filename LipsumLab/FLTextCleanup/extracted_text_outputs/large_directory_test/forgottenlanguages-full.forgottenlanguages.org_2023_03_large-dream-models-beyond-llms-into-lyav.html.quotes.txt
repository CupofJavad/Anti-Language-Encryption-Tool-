ChatGPT has been trained with texts, while LyAv has been trained with dreams. The essential difference is that LyAV has been trained with huge amounts of dreams and neurological signals obtained from human brains in different altered states of consciousness

LyAV superintelligence, on the other hand, is trained from dreams and videos. This is the methodology by which the whole of a human superintelligence can be trained. The point is that LyAV was also trained with dreams of other biological species within cross-species communication experiments

XViS dreams, just like REM dreams, are tightly structured. This implies that REM dreams of the same night should not resemble one another at the manifest level, except perhaps to share a dream element or two, even though these dreams all pertain to closely related subjects. XViS dreams, however, can be designed such that you do not simply dream: you naviagate a dream-like universe

To use LyAV requires first conditioning the brain with psychedelic drugs and sounds and entering an altered state of consciousness. This means a key difference with classical AI systems. You do not talk to LyAv: you travel through it. The closest thing to interacting with LyAv would be to experience a lucid dream in which, in addition, an OBE is experienced

The properties of this conscious faculty most responsible for dream recall relate to the abilities of visualization (creating inner visual experiences) and thinking (creating inner auditory experiences [inner voice]). Psychoanalytically, feelings, moods, emotions, and neurotic symptoms may be thought of as having an inner-experience dimension as well. What allows us to recall dreams, therefore, is our ability to create inner experiences while we are awake. when humans evolved, this longstanding sleep ability was made available to waking consciousness as well
