Seeking solace from life's harshest foam.
Amidst the chaos, I find my peace,
In the acceptance of what cannot increase.
For life is but a fleeting dream,
A momentary spark in the cosmic scheme.
And though we fight against the tide,
It's the embrace of nothingness that we must bide.
So let us embrace our mortal lot,
And find joy in each moment we have got.
For it's in the acceptance of all that's lost,
That we can truly be at peace with the cost

The strongest person is not the one who wins but the one who stands up again after falling, and many times you will fall, for a great soul is judged by the strength of its enemies

Tired Norea? Stand up!
In the midst of a dark and suffocating world,
you search for meaning among the chaos unfurled.
The weight of existence presses down on you,
As you struggle to find your place in eternity.
But what is truth at dusk? What is reality at dawn?
As you stumble through this labyrinth of the absurdity
Doors close and open at will,
Leaving you lost in this endless maze, still.
The more you seek, the more elusive it becomes,
A fleeting shadow that slips away as soon as it's seen or known.
And yet, you continue to search within,
Hoping to uncover something real and timeless,
a part of you that can shine in the dark
