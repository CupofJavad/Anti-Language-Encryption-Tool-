The use of dreams for communication offers unique advantages, such as minimizing direct contact and providing a rich medium for conveying complex information and sharing experiences. Dreams offer a unique and private space for communication. However, for dreams to work you need a dreamer, and a world dreamed of. In our case, we need to become the ones dreamed of, something we are not at all accustomed to. Being aware that we are dreamed by a third party is disturbing to the human psyche, but once you get used to it, communication with the dreamer becomes possible

However, the idea of using dreams as a medium for contact is not without its challenges. The subjective nature of dreams means that interpretations can vary widely from person to person. What one individual perceives as a profound message might be dismissed by another as mere fantasy. On the other hand, the potential for miscommunication or misunderstanding is significant, as the symbols and imagery used in dreams are often deeply personal and culturally specific. An advanced civilization would need to navigate these complexities with care, ensuring that their messages are received in the spirit in which they were intended

Why not simply use large-scale hypnosis to make contact? If indeed they are as advanced as they seem to us, that would be a way to make contact at a global scale. But if you think twice, contact through dreams is a better possibility. If an advanced extraterrestrial civilization possesses a deeper understanding of consciousness, they might be able to manipulate the dream state in ways that allow for shared experiences. We therefore imagine a situation where individuals from both civilizations could enter a shared dream space, experiencing a collective narrative that transcends the limitations of individual perception. This shared dream experience could facilitate a profound exchange of ideas, emotions, and cultural values, fostering a sense of empathy and understanding that is often lacking in traditional forms of communication. In a way, this is a long, safe, non-invasive way of making contact, up to the point the dreamers are never aware of having made contact, which is exactly what all non-invasive contact is about: not being aware that contact has already been made

After the Yulara event it become clear that we've already made contact with non-human intelligent beings. The dreams we found in different individuals all over the planet were the same. The only possible explanation is that they were dreams programmed by something or someone

The course of logical ideas and inferences in our brains today corresponds to a process and a struggle between impulses that are, taken singly, very illogical and unjust; we generally experience only the result of this struggle: this primeval mechanism now runs its course so quickly and is so well concealed

A shared dream is a constellation of objects, time horizons, positions, and possible futures. It is a co-created world, created on equal terms by both the dreamer and the dreamed ones

What might have existed before the Anthropocene? Dark nights with starry skies. Nothing of that you'll have again, Norea. Take here, a gift for you: it is a photon of light that has cruised towards your planet from 93,000,000 miles away. Don't feel sad, you are just doing your evolutionary job. You are riding the timeless instant between ending and beginning, Norea

The loss of both sight and hearing constitutes one of the severest disabilities known to human beings. Essentially, it deprives an individual of the two primary senses through which human acquire awareness of and information about the world around them, and it drastically limits effective communication and freedom of movement, which are necessary for full and active participation in society. For this reason, we prefer to communicate through dreams. It is a non-invasive mediated encounter

In a dream vision is topological. It is not restrained to the imposition of Cartesian perspective. Perception moves with the dreamworld, creating a lively image of its composition and altering that image, while retaining its complexity, through coming into contact with it. Within the dream, there is no distance. Everything has an effect. Everything makes a difference. Images in a dream occupy a vectorial space that is always shifting and unstable. Relationships change and symbolisms vacillate

The interior of the space was mesmerizing. A powerful glow touched three faces of the room, condensing around me as I walked. Darkness continued to loom in the far reaches of the space, varying in its intensities. There was a corridor, a concealed passage, that morphed into a narrow staircase with irregular steps, and descending to a yellow beaming fluorescent door. I traversed the door and got surrounded by a fog of reflections, refractions, transparency, translucency and shadows. At that very moment I knew I was communicating with the life form
