It is I who am Eleleth, the great angel who stands in the presence of the Light. I have been sent to speak with you and save you from the grasp of the lawless. And I shall teach you about your root

It is I who am understanding. I am one of the four light-givers, who stand in the presence of the great invisible spirit. Do you think these rulers have any power over you? None of them can prevail against the root of truth; for on its account he appeared in the final ages; and these authorities will be restrained. And these authorities cannot defile you and that generation; for your abode is in incorruptibility, where the virgin spirit dwells, who is superior to the authorities of chaos and to their universe
