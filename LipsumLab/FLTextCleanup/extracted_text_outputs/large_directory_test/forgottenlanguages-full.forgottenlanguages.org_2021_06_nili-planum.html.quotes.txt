It is very bad luck that of the many Noachian sites in Mars, they had to choose precisely the Jezero crater. This is obviously a problem for us, a problem we will increasingly face in the future as the number of civilian robotic mission to Mars increases

it appears to be a circular metal structure that would serve as a closing hatch. The entrance to the tunnels, clearly artificial, suggests the existence of structures located below the surface

There is no doubt that the structures on the slopes of Nyd were excavated long after the impact that formed the crater, and probably long after life ceased on Mars

Angelica crater is probably the best evidence of what to expect. It is a huge ovoid structure in whose interior, very deteriorated, we found what resemble supporting beams. The East entry of the ovoid is blocked by residual accumulation of sand, pebbles, and cobbles resulting from erosion of the ridge above. The South entry, on the contrary, is blocked by debris from mineralized fractures or clastic dike intrusions. The current view is that the debris corresponds to exploited fractures generated by the Isidis impact. If that's the case, then obviously the artificial ovoid structure was built before the Isidis impact. We cannot reconcile that data with Nyd's site data

the engineering change proposal recommended to move the station from DENIED to DENIED, as this new site on the surface of Aurorae Planum has the correct diameter, and a smooth, solid, and flat floor that would ease the installation and maintenance of the DENIED radar

Apart from foraminifera, fossil bacteria, and biogenetic marks on rocks, we found no traces of life in that region of the planet, I mean, no traces of indigenous organisms. However, we found three rocks that show clear signs of having been perfectly abraded. That is, someone else was there before any of our landers did
