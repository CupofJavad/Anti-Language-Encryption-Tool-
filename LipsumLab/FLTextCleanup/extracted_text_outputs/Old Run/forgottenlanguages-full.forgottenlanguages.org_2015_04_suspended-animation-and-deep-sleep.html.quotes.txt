Cryo-preservation of SEEs is easier than cryo-preservation of humans, but there is no way to induce humans to initiate self-cessation once the mission reaches the point in which humans are totally dependable. Available resources are limited and humans are known for being extremely resource-intensive assets. Suicide-inducing drugs are not reliable, and programmable life-cessation techniques have proven to work only in quite specific situations: there where the human crew ignore their fate

In the near future, emphasis will be on life-cessation systems (LCS), instead of on life-support systems (LSS). The only way to have standard humans get inside the LCS voluntarily is by them ignoring they will be terminated. Missions will be one-way. No return trip is possible. The further the mission progresses, the more dependable humans are. A simple computation will convince you that, were we to explore Jupiter with a manned-mission, the cheapest solution is to dispose of a return-to-Earth profile, which calls for human crew to be terminated at the end of the mission
