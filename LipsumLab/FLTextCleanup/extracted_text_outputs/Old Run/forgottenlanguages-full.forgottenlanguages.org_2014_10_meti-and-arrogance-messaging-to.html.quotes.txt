We know of an intelligent species that sent a message. And we know of an intelligent species that received the message. The message could be the Phaistos Disk, or an excerpt of the Voynich Manuscript. Both the sender and the receiver are the same species: humans. Yet, the message is still indecipherable by humans themselves!
