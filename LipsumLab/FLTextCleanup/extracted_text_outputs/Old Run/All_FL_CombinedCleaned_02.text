A three dimensional being would have difficulty describing four dimensional objects or events since he would have but a three dimensional vocabulary to call upon. The highly unusual and somewhat confusing language that Ezekiel used to describe what he saw might well be the result of the inadequacy of our language to describe hyperdimensional objects or events; in turn, Jehu's description of what he saw is more scientific and detailed, not because he spoke a different language, rather because he used mathematical terminology - albeit limited - to help in the description of events

Right, really, no joking, but the language of Sol-3 STO-2075 scientists describing quantum effects clearly resembles Ezekiel's when he tried to describe his arrival to DENIED. You may laugh at Ezekiel's childish description of wheels inside wheels and bright-blinding thrones, much as you can laugh at current description of D-branes and hyperdimensional space-time. You are today's Ezekiel, my friend

Norea, learn that all kingdoms have a law given and there are many kingdoms, for there is no space in the which there is no kingdom and there is no kingdom in the which there is no space, either a greater or a lesser kingdom. And unto every kingdom, Norea, is given a law and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions

To approach light speed or faster than light speed what is needed is
not
anti-gravity
but
anti-mass/inertia. Superluminal speed cannot be achieved until at least light speed is achieved

if the ship speed is many multiples of the speed of light, the duration in spacecraft time is the distance divided by the speed of light, and that determines the spacecraft time elapsed during the mission and the physical aging of the crew. Thus, even with an 80-year lifespan of the spacecraft crew, the crew could only reach, and return from, stars that are less than 40 light years distant from Earth. So for less-than-light speed (subluminal) travel, the limitation is the lifespan of the Earth-bound observers, while for greater-than-light speed (superluminal) travel, it is the lifespan of the spacecraft crew that is the limitation

to instruct DENIED to approach the area and recover the moored logger so far reported as lost; to perform a detailed analysis to discern whether the mooring line was deliberately snapped by DENIED and to proceed to destroy the logger in the event recovery is not feasible

We know of no signal with those features. These signals varied in length from exactly 1,5 to 2,78 seconds. Comparison with whale calls rendered no match, and neither comparison with any signal on the DOLYN database. Signal analysis determined the source level of this peak signal in excess of 315 dB re 1 μPa mean squared pressure, which is extremely high

DOLYN incorporates translational acoustic/RF communication - TARF - subsystems. These are meant to allow communication between subsmerged and airboerne assets by exploiting the fact that underwater acoustic signals travel as pressure waves, and that these waves cause displacements of the water surface when they impinge on the water-air boundary. Transmitted signals are then decoded by an airborne radar which measures and decodes these surface displacements by estimating the phase of the reflected signal

The team was tasked with the goal of testing whether radiation belt electron precipitation could be induced using VLF transmitters. We have no directed energy weapons producing a beam of highly energetic charged particles capable of knocking down an airplane; however, Earth is constantly being hit by highly energetic particles which are absorbed by the atmosphere. The idea under test was whether we could somehow weaken the atmosphere at a specific point using VLF and therefore open a channel through which HEPs could flow and hit a target

Sure, one of the aircraft’s three air data inertial reference units exhibited a data-spike failure mode, during which it transmitted a significant amount of incorrect data on air data parameters to other aircraft systems, without flagging that this data was invalid. But the question remains on what caused that data-spike in the first place. On the other hand, the occurrence on 7 October 2008 was the only occasion when incorrect data from an air data inertial reference unit had resulted in inadvertent elevator commands. So the question remains as to what caused that data-spike

the three known data-spike occurrences all took place within 1,000 km of Learmonth. Given that the locations were in a broadly similar geographical area, the investigation examined potential sources of EMI in the area. Two potential sources were identified: the Harold E. Holt Naval Communication Station located at Exmouth (near Learmonth), and a nearby high frequency (HF) radio communications site. The naval communication station transmitted at a very low frequency (VLF) of 19.8 kHz, and the transmission power was about 1 megawatt using an omni-directional antenna. The station was transmitting at the time of the three data-spike occurrences

Lion Air Flight 610 plummeted nose-first into the water killing all 189 people on board. Again, the official culprit was false inputs from the angle of attack sensor. If the sensor data is wrong, the system could cause the plane to dive. And this is independent on whether the plane was manufactured by Boeing, Airbus or any other manufacturer; it doesn't depend either on the particular AOS. You simply get your VLF transmitter on and planes in 1,000 Km around start noise-diving

researchers exposed subjects to various VLF-sferics programs characterized by different electric and magnetic field amplitudes. The square impulses with frequencies of 10 and 100 kHz were presented with pulse repetition frequencies of 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 Hz. The simulation provoked complaints of dizziness in some of the subjects who had been diagnosed as labile vagotonics, which implies an overresponsivity of the parasympathetic nervous system

The Boeing 737-700 was only 15 seconds from smashing into the ground in Norfolk when It fell from 15,000 feet to just 5,600ft, losing height at a rate of up to 350 feet every second.

Occam’s Razor can only be applied if the choices it is applied to is correct

What is it that drives the evolution of human consciousness? The one-word answer is ‘necessity’

a system cannot be completely understood in terms of itself

The perception of time is coupled to dynamical processes often associated with entropic flow; but entropic time does not correlate with clock time. And clock time only correlates with psychological time for certain states of consciousness. If a process is harmonic or occurs at a microscopic level where the laws of physics are temporally symmetric all conception of time can be lost; thus the nature of time has maintained itself as a dilemma

Fully developed intelligence has no need for physical travel. A form of inter-dimensional superposition would be tantamount to providing an ontological presence invisible to us but not to them

Carl Jung was looking for a unifying principle behind meaningful coincidence, individual consciousness, and the totality of space and time. The concept of “
synchronicity
” was born from reviewing more than 400 of Pauli’s dreams. After several years of discussion, they defined synchronicity as “
the coincidence in time of two or more causally unrelated events which have the same or similar meaning
.” Synchronicity describes some striking and apparently inexplicable “meaningful coincidences” or “significantly related patterns of chance” when, for example, the contents of a dream are paralleled in a pattern of seemingly unconnected external events

A particular assembly can be defined by a short or single barrage of synchronous spikes, whereby each individual neuron needs to contribute only a single or few spikes. Such self-organized, synchronous coalitions can be established very rapidly. But you still need a
free coalition of systems
, one of which must be a time-varying information density system. This, it seems, is the role played by Denebian probes

You are free, but you are under control. There exists a master control system because the activity of living is a process of control, and by understanding
control
as the varying of motor output to maintain perceptual input in stable reference states, the mystery of consciousness dissolves. Control is one of nature’s greatest accomplishments and consciousness as a controlled perception may well be the most stunning of our human perceptual capabilities. Time-travel won't allow you to escape the control by whomever are those in charge of controlling Reality. But it will get you closer to them

Norea, you simply cannot detach the psyche of an observer from any observed phenomenon

We are concerned with the possibility of physical objects (e.g., persons) travelling backwards through time. If we were to suppose the existence of disembodied souls and spirits or disernbodied Cartesian minds then time travel may be quite easy or even trivial for such immaterial beings

We need to make a decision: either we discuss the possibility of the travel involving other possible worlds or we focus on the travel to our own world in the past. The notion here is that the travel is really just a journey to another possible world that somehow exists parallel to ours (in another dimension) and is very similar to ours. If this is all that time travel were, then it would not be 'time' travel at all, rather it would be travel between possible worids

to travel backwards in time is to travel through time such that one's persona1 time is later and external time is earlier

the analysis of Denebian probes involves modeling hypothetical subcognitive processes as a collection of many individual cognitive agents. A useful metaphor is to think of the brain as an ant colony, where the individual ants correspond with the subcognitive agents

The “parallel terraced scan” is the modeling algorithm that searches for a solution to a given perception problem by simulating many of these agents working in parallel to solve a problem. For instance, in the Seek-Whence domain, certain agents may act as scouts that examine the number sequence for duplicate numbers. Other agents might look for increasing pairs of numbers. Still others might propose that certain numbers be grouped together, so that yet other agents that deal with groups of numbers could examine groups for similarity

Denebian probes arrange themselves as a network, or swarm if you like, and they obviously do their job. The job, in this context, is the transfer of information and complexity across the vastness of interstellar space. Perhaps this is all a survival strategy, perhaps they are simply calling our attention and are waiting for us to respond. Perhaps they are already communicating with us in a way we cannot understand

To devise a good explanatory analogy, it won’t suffice to make it down-to-earth; in fact, adding lots of concrete details can easily cloud up an explanation, making the gist get lost in the fog. What’s crucial in devising a good explanatory analogy is how clearly the invented scenario embodies an abstraction. That is, a successful explanatory analogy is one in which an abstract conceptual skeleton has been very naturally realized in a concrete situation, so the two go together like hand and glove

given a sequence, what you want to do is this: scan it quickly for various easy-to-detect characteristics that suggest which operators to throw out (this can of course only be intelligent guesswork), and then take the operators that escaped the pruning and arrange them in a sensible order, again guided by information from the quick scan. Typical results of a quick scan would include such things as: the degree of presence of repeated terms, a quick-and-dirty measure of the sequence's smoothness, a rough estimate of its rate of growth, observations of roughly periodic behavior, and so on

intelligence emerges out of the interactions of many thousands of parallel processes that take place within milliseconds and are inaccessible to introspection. And that's exactly how Denebian probes work. Obviously, you must replace 'milliseconds' by 'femtoseconds' for this definition to apply to Denebian probes

It seems the only way by which one can obtain knowledge of the mechanisms of a Denebian probe it is simply by interacting with the program over a period of time in an unrestricted manner. This means that covert mechanisms can be deeply probed and eventually revealed merely by means of watching overt behavior, though obviously you first need to accept the idea that a Denebian probe is harmless to you, something still pending proof

At that time we were doing research on the sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome (SUNDS), funded by DoD within the framework of Soldier 2.0 program. As you know, dreams, daydreams, and fantasy contain varying amounts of memory and imagination images but often introduce a time factor; they deal with a series of images taking place in chronological order. Often a person cannot distinguish between reality and these inner visual experiences. DoD asked us to explore whether we could induce SUNDS into healthy people, in other words, they wanted to come up with a new psychoweapon that could be used against hostile forces. They specifically asked for us to develop weapons able to induce nightmares so vivid, detailed, and beyond the reach of conscious control that people couldn't know they are internal and therefore mistake them for events in the external world

Tests of the new weapon were ran in California, Oregon, Minnesota, Washington, Iowa, Oklahoma and Ohio, resulting in the death of 19 men and one woman, aged 21-62. The targeted subpopulation were Laotians. They all died in their sleep in the early morning hours

Twilight state imagery can be of two types. Hypnogogic when it occurs preceding sleep, and hypnopompic when it occurs just after sleep before being fully awake. The weapon we designed was of the hypnopompic type

Civilian doctors started to talk about Oriental Nightmare Death Syndrome, a rare condition according to which coroners dictaminated that four Laotians who died in St. Paul may have been literally frightened to death while having nightmares

we knew slow, rhythmic stimulation of various senses (flashing lights, electric pulse current, beeping sounds, etc., induce occurrences which result in a deviation of the normal stream of consciousness that provide a fecund condition for the development of this form of visual imagery, so we started building upon that

Soldier 2.0 is a Military Human Enhancement program. Human enhancement is defined as the process of endowing an individual with an ability that goes beyond the typical level or statistically normal range of functioning for humans generally (or the personal unenhanced capabilities of a particular individual), where the ability is either integrated into the body or is so closely worn or connected that it confers an advantage similar to an internal or organic enhancement that transforms the person

Bodily integrity? Listen, true informed consent is impossible to achieve in situations involving the military hierarchy, but even if a soldier expresses the will to exert his right to bodily integrity the will of the soldier could have been modified somehow in the first place. Yes, you never know if your will is really yours, much as the target ignores his visions has nothing to do with Reality. That's the essence of Soldier 3.0

The program was disguised as a research on behavioral responses of bears to tests of repellents, deterrents, and aversive conditioning. The weapon was developed in DENIED, Montana, from 1976 to 1984. For the outside world we were a group of experts investigating ways to reduce human—bear conflicts caused by surprise encounters and bear use of human foods. Funny, I've never seen a bear in my life, you see, but I've seen people dieing from nightmares..

The Soviets developed their mycotoxins in the 50's. They even tested their weapons exposing innocent people to them. The Dyatlov Pass incident only proved you can turn an otherwise healthy normal guy into a psycho. Ours is a totally different weapon and the only thing we have in common is that we tested it on innocent refugees, too

The idea that the first contact with a supercivilization will be through  machines, and more specifically, by means of probes, is now the accepted paradigm. On the other hand, we must be ready for a non-friendly contact or, to be less  dramatic, for a contact in which the exchange of information is termed as hostile  by either partner. In this sense, we need to design proper contact strategies  based on real-life examples. This means we need to consider probes as predators  engaged in the finding of preys, and we need to account for the worst case scenario

Defenses can be divided into two categories: primary and secondary. Primary defenses are those that prevent detection by the predator. Secondary defenses promote survival after detection. The primary defenses are adaptive silence, stealth as in the modern military sense of the word, and acoustic crypsis. Secondary defenses will include prevention of localization, acoustic aposematism, mimicry, and communications jamming

The key defense used by Denebian probes is based on crypsis, that is, avoiding detection while remaining in plain sight. If we see them this is because they want us to see them

We understand we cannot tell the difference between a space exploration probe sent to make a first contact  with a civilization, and an interstellar probe aimed at detecting potential preys. Signals intercepted by another species, particularly in such cases as predators locating prey, should be considered cues as they are not designed to enhance information transfer to those receivers. This is certainly true if one considers predator and prey in isolation, and this is exactly the situation if we send a probe to DENIED to  meet the Denebian probe

Contact, Norea? Intelligence requires intelligence, and 
you are first required to show some

Genesis probes are used in missions aiming to offer terrestrial life new evolutionary pathways on potentially habitable but hitherto barren exoplanets. These missions are designed to establish an ecosphere of unicellular lifeforms on potentially habitable but hitherto barren exoplanets. A Genesis probe is a wafer-sized  interstellar probe, of which several of them are launched comprising a swarm targeting a selected star system.  Bear in mind that a Genesis probe is a slow craft and that they are only one part of a major system

Our best bet so far is the indirect detection of exo-civilizations by searching for technosignatures from distant sources  outside the solar systems. However, this also means that we need to accept the assumption that the technology of those exo-civilizations  is somehow akin to ours in what concerns the basic principles upon which that technology is based. This, clearly, need not be the case.  The other approach is direct detection of material evidence for an exo-civilization's visit to Sol-3 or our solar system. Denebian probes  fall into this category, while Giselian beacons fall into the first category

Biological civilizations have finite lifetimes, thus an eventual balance should be achieved between the settlement of currently empty worlds and the death of biological civilizations on previously settled worlds. This also means that if civilizations have a  finite duration, then it is possible that Sol-3 was settled some time in the distant past and all traces of that settlement have been erased by geological evolution (this is the so-called Cambrian Probes Hypothesis)

Some researchers hold the idea that that expansion proceeds via short-range Geneseis-type probes which travel to a nearby system and seed it. This is done via Cambrian-type probes. Once life emerges on that planet evolution would  proceed as programed giving rise to human-like beings able to engineer new probes and launching additional probes to an unsettled  nearby system. In this approach, humans are the result of the Cambrian seeding probes and they are expected to engineer and launch  probes to the nearby Alpha Centauri star-system. Though this approach seems to be a slow settling one from a biological  species' perspective, we need to bear in mind that the original exo-civilization is metabiological, therefore settling time  is not an issue for them

The settlement strategy based on hopping from one star system to the next assumes that there are always plenty of neighboring systems  within range. But what happens once the colonization front reaches the Local Void? In this case short-range Genesis-type probes wouldn't do  the job and a new type of probes with a more advanced technology would be needed. This could be done if every new settled planet  is seeded with increasingly more intelligent and evolved lifeforms, but it is hard to find a solution on how to achieve this starting with  an original Genesis-type fixed design, unless some sort of super-AI could emerge during the settling process

My objection is that, for what we know, purely informational or synthetic robotic lifeforms are not expected to arise from the evolutionary process and, in any case, they are not the starting point of intelligence. Rather, they are products of additional cultural and technological evolution. In other words, synthetic, robotic lifeforms are produced by biologically evolved intelligences and not the other way around. Quite a different  thing is whether the biologically evolved intelligence that created the Denebian probe is long ago gone by the time the probe reaches our solar system. But if that's the case, my view is the biologically evolved intelligence already took that scenario  under consideration and perhaps the probe encodes all the necessary elements to replicate life and recreate it in the target planet. There's no need to ask about motivation and intent, for we are biological beings ourselves and we perfectly know what the motivation  behind our acts are, namely: survival of the species

Should be a slow, graded, step-by-step process. Probes should remain at the edge of the target star-system; probes must wait for the contacted civilization to always make the first move, and the reply must carefully match the technological level of the contacted civilization

so that, in the end, you have an autonomous sensing, computing, and communication system  packed into a cubic millimeter speck to form the basis of integrated, massively distributed  sensor networks that in turn control intelligent functionalized mats of biofilms that  cover the target planet, and the problem is how to get rid of those tiny sensors  once the terraforming activity has finished in order for the resulting intelligent  species to never know we did what we did

The current situation is that of relegating humans to more mundane activities such as maintenance and housekeeping of planets, while interstellar probes take the responsibility to explore the Universe. However, humans have shown to be extremely clumsy in fulfilling their task and, actually, they seem to be very good at doing quite the opposite: devastating planets

any AI-based interstellar mission is based on one or more agents, where by 'agent' we understand any system situated within and apart of an environment that senses that environment and acts on it, over time, in pursuit of its own agenda and so as to effect what it senses in the future

Contact Theory is a prejudice theory, and we can thus add that it is a theory that seeks to eliminate hate prejudice

The human mind is a prejudiced mind, the tendency of which is to personify evil and thus lead to the failure of human solidarity towards a co-operative life

The problem here lies in the fact that we are not used to be the object of research; we have always been  the ones researching and observing phenomena and objects; for the first time, we are the ones being  studied, observed, and this causes anxiety and distress. It is not that our prejudices make us see  an alien probe as a threat, it is that we really cannot conceive we are under someone else's microscope.  This time we are the bacteria being researched, probed, and tested.

There are three possible scenarios here. Either the Universe is a computer itself, therefore 
located externally to the system it is controlling (a); or the Universe is a system which contains 
computers internally (b); or the Universe is just the result of a simulation being run by a computer 
located externally to it (c). The question we face is whether we can find a way to discover which 
of these three scenarios does best fit our current observations

The operation of a massive quantum computer to be able to manipulate realistic quantum systems (i.e., Universes)
faces the acute problem of the computer being unavoidably subject to an interaction with the
environment it is controlling. Specifically, this interaction causes decoherence, which in turn 
makes the quantum computer to behave unpredictably. It seems a logical option to place such computers 
at the center of cosmic voids to minimize interaction with the environment, but even in that case you 
are to expect some interaction, which means  those computers could be hackable by another hypercivilization. 
Obviously, the best arrangement would be to have the quantum computer outside the Universe itself, which leads 
us back to the old problem of controlling a system without being part of that system

The goal of population neuroscience is to understand how the brain is shaped by 
internal effects such as genes and from external factors such as the 
social and physical environment. Sadly enough, this science is clearly underdeveloped 
in Sol-3 and by the time humans start to understand its implications it will be too late

There is a growing tendency for humans to ignore the powerful effects that the 
environment can have on their brains and behavior. The stronger this tendency is, the further 
they are from achieving the necessary technological skills to explore the Universe

Humans are a social species and require social interactions to maintain 
positive physical and mental health. The no-contact strategy is an optimum one for most 
of Sol-3 development. However, there is a point in time at which prolonging such a no-contact 
strategy can produce in humans an unbearable feeling of cosmic loneliness the consequences of which, 
as we know, are always linked to self-destruction. In this scenario the question arises as to 
who is responsible for such a destruction. Early contact is as harmful as a late contact

While the challenge of finding the core
function of human and animal sleep remains unknown when tested under the null
hypothesis, studies on the neural correlates of consciousness during meditation
have revealed neuroplasticity effects. The synchrony of gamma brain oscillations
reflecting various styles of meditation or attention, also known as the binding
problem, may be related to conscious experiences. This binding problem with
gamma brain oscillatory synchronization also arises in relation to sensory awareness
or perception, affecting the perception of time and hallucinatory experiences
in various disorders of consciousness such as severe schizophrenic and déjà vu
(in healthy or epileptic) patients

Near Death Experiences can be induced in a controlled way to generate 
a special state of consciousness allowing us to access the unconscious and 
subconscious level which, in turn, allow us to perform dream content analysis 
and introduce the needed corrections into the system. Conscious states are influenced by the
biochemical and biophysical substrates of wakefulness, sleep and dreaming, thus by 
modifying in real-time those substrates we virtually control sleep and dreaming

Analyzing precognitive dreams tells you a lot about altered states of consciousness 
because the dream experiences tap into the unconscious states. 
No need to use drugs, just a manipulation of brain waves in both the space and time 
domains is all we need

The human perception of time is linked to experience and how that
perception can be altered. The transitions between the waking and other special states
of consciousness, such as NDE, sleep, dream, daydreaming, mind-wandering,
trance, dissociation, meditation and hypnosis, offer an explanation for various
extraordinary elements that humans report, of which visions and prognostic dreams 
are the main focus of the XViS project

In the long run, transfering and storing consciousness is what we need to escape 
the physical experience. Clearly, our physical body is designed to allow us to 
interact with our terrestrial environment, yet our planet is just one of the myriad 
environments that exist in the Universe. We do not need to travel to other star systems 
or galaxies; what we really need is our consciousness to travel, at the speed of light, to distant 
points in the Universe. And believe me, it is much easier to get our consciousness to travel 
than buiilding a starship to get us to another star

Is it possible to send an object or even just information backwards through time, without bringing temporal paradoxes with it? It all looks as if the Universe were a computer in which 'the present' is the runtime, data is read from 'the past', and results are generated in 'the future'


There have been several experiments where photons appear to travel faster than the 
speed of light, and hence backwards through time. However, the real 
test is whether any information can move backwards through time, and so far only once we 
had success in demonstrating causality violations, and it wasn't fun at all

You need to understand that quantum teleportation is not the same as the common term 'teleportation' because no 
matter is transported at all, just information. It is also known as entanglement-assisted 
teleportation because as well as using a conventional communication channel, it uses 
entanglement to transmit quantum information non-locally. However, because classical 
information cannot be transmitted instantaneously, quantum teleportation cannot be 
used for communication at superluminal speeds, so teleportation alone is not a valid 
form of time travel

You need to wait for the biological system to enter into the sleep state; they always do, and this is 
something you cannot induce at a distance. Humans tend to sleep some 7 hours and they tend to do it 
by night. This has to do with both their photobiological nature and the orbital parameters of their 
home planet. Once in the sleep state you can initiate contact. Unless you leave behind a physical evidence 
of the contact, the subject will never tell the difference between the contact an a dream. Visual 
imagery must be fed carefully as the human brain tends to fear what it does not understand and readily 
turns inocuous images into a nightmare, a special kind of dreams that are frightening and unpleasant 
for the dreamer

Contact using the paraphysical channel should not be made during the first few hours after falling 
asleep as most humans do not recall their dreams upon awakening. The LEB contact strategy requires a 
delicate balance between different sleep states which do differ in duration and intensity

How does memory work in a time travel scenario? What do we recall once we've traveled in time? 
Time travel does not involve changing the past; it involves changing what we do remember about the 
past. This is what we've learned from Giselians

Of all possible dream states a human can experience, hypnagogia is the one showing a higher success 
probability for the LEB strategy. However, loosening of ego boundaries is experienced as a frightening 
condition by humans. It is thus essential to make them have the impression of familiarity toward the
person, place, or objects upon which our contact visual imagery is built

Dreaming helps to create, rather than reveal, past experiences. This is why dream technologies are 
key in any successful time traveling development

The desired information isn't lost
over time; it is either never registered in memory to begin with, or not
sought after at the moment it is needed, because attention is focused elsewhere. Another 
issue to avoid is the one related to persistence, in which the subject entails repeated recall of disturbing
information or events that he would prefer to banish from his mind altogether, that is, remembering 
what we cannot forget, even though we wish that we could

we will need to immerse ourselves in the dark sides of memory and dreaming if we wish to make of LEB 
a valid contact strategy, and we need to fully explore the properties of the environment in which 
the memory system operates if we wish to have a slight chance of making contact with them

It is clear that a time
traveller is not as simple as a spatial one and to visit your younger ego cannot be like a
journey to an old aunt in the countryside. If occurrents and continuants can coexist
and can be caught in ordinary language and ordinary thought, an object going through
a CTC is not simply an occurrent or a continuant. It is possible that we have to leave
place for this third type of temporal object, something that isn’t yet present in our
language and cannot be accommodated with our minds. The presence of a time
traveller can be considered as a third type of existence: he is in a real world but he can
influence no objects in it that are temporal parts of the whole to which he belongs. It
remind us of the difference between quantum particles and macroscopic objects or the
difference between wave and corpuscle. It is better to accept it as a new type of
temporal existence and not to force it into our classical view of occurrent and
continuants

All thoughts, theories and mathematics that the
human mind can produce can be observed by the
observer. This means that the observer has the
highest degree of complexity, which is then
followed by mind in lower dimensional Hilbert
spaces

Consciousness can be viewed from the standpoint of
evolutionary biology as an adaptation in the
sense of a trait that increases fitness. Within this 
framework, consciousness allows living organisms to make
distinctions between appearance and reality, and this 
clearly means we do require conscious probes to explore 
Denebian probes. This calls for a manned exploration mission 
to DP-2147 as we lack the technology to confer consciousness 
to nuts and bolts probes. Yet, on the other hand, biological systems
- such as humans - are extremely unreliable eyewitnesses and you simply 
cannot trust them in a data gathering mission. In the end it seems 
a Denebian probe is designed to be only understood by another Denebian probe

The density of information
is correlated with intelligence, which means that
consciousness as the n-dimensional Hilbert space
is of infinite intelligence. Human senses are threedimensional
and can perceive only the threedimensional
aspect of energy-information, in the
form of ordinary 3D space, 3D particles and 3D
massive bodies

A Denebian probe may be considered a syntropic
phenomena, that is, a process 
responsible of the evolution of the biological
complexity. Life consists in a set of syntropic phenomena and cannot be
only reduced to physical and chemical processes
and therefore a source of information exists which
supervenes chemical and physical processes with
the aim of creation of biological systems

reality may be perceived as
a vast interlacing network of discrete fields of
oscillations that interact with the vibrational fields
of life systems, a communication process in which
photons of various energy content and solitons
play an essential role

if geometrical information fluxes of photons
and phonons converted to scalar standing waves
in a 4D toroidal topology can be considered the
basis for the origin of consciousness states, modulating 
those fluxes would theoretically allow you to generate specific consciousness states at will, 
regardless of the target species

Time is the longest distance between two places

Imagine a world in which there is no time. Only images

In a dream, events are triggered by other events, not by time


In a world without future, each moment is the end of the world

the experimentation carried out at XViS has to do with what is happening in the minds of the subjects 
when exposed to extra sensory perception experiments and experiments that trigger altered states of consciousness. 
The subjects under investigation at the Lyell Avenue Lab do all enter into psychic experiences that are 
thoroughly recorded and utterly analyzed. What seems to happen during 
these time is that the subjects relax their critical faculties and allows a dream-like state 
to pervade their mind. It is under these circumstances that synthetic dreams are injected and the subject's 
response recorded

A series of experiments focused on the use of music as a means of psychic communication and on the 
communication of telepathic signals via acoustical material and its effect upon the listener. 
We found that family pairings and especially friendships could be viewed as a
strong factor in ESP enhancement where extra sensory communication may be
 important. This may be due to the fact that in a non-psychical scenario such pairings 
are more accustomed to communication with each other

Psi is apparently not a human ability, though this doesn't mean that paranormal phenomena do not exist. 
What happens is that paranormal phenomena may result from motivations
or intentions that are not associated with identifiable living beings. We call these information 
systems 'exotic logic systems' -  ELS - and the main motivation of our research program 
is to try to understand how to exchange information with an ELS

The indication for at least the positive trials could be that telepathic communication was responsible for the 
correlation between the imagery expressed and the music sent

Perception of and response to environmental factors are basic
information processing capabilities of living organisms

Evidence that allegedly paranormal phenomena do not
conform to the usual assumptions for experimental research does not mean
that paranormal phenomena never occur. Different research paradigms,
strategies, and methods may be needed, and today XViS provides such a framework
for the research on these topics

Motif, a spin-off of Ginkgo Bioworks, aims to identify a cornucopia of  natural ingredients, including the vitamins and proteins found in foods  such as milk or meat. It will then produce them using engineered yeasts  and bacteria in a fermentation process similar to brewing beer. The  company plans to develop ingredients for plant-based versions of meat  and dairy as well as “cultured meat” grown from animal cells in  bioreactors

Sustainable Bioproducts, a Chicago-based startup, raised $33 million in  March to create animal protein substitutes using super-efficient  microbes found in the volcanic springs of Yellowstone National Park

The
California Rice Experiment Station
has found a partner in Albaugh  LLC to help bring their ROXY herbicide-tolerant rice system to market

ROXY rice, which stands for resistant to oxyfluorfen, was discovered in  2014 by Rice Experiment Station breeders. That summer, they identified  29 plants that showed resistance and further testing confirmed nine with  oxyfluorfen resistance. Genetic studies at the station determined the  herbicide-resistance trait is controlled by a single as recessive gene.  That makes it relatively easy to transfer to other varieties

Insect Allies is a research program from DARPA aimed at the development  and dispersal of insect vectors to deliver genetically modified viruses  to crops. The goal is therefore to use insects to deliver viruses  carrying specific traits to modify crops during one growing season.  Karys is a research program from DENIED aiming at developing a mutagenic  agent that would affect the DARPA-developed virus modifying its behavior  in order to affect the seeds of plants and disrupt future growing  seasons. Both programs are a spinoff from Project Pandora, which focused  on umbraviruses designed to pose a lethal constraint on the yield of  opium poppy crops all over the world

The AGP - advanced geminivirus program - resulted in the creation of  DENIED bioweapon. AGP is classified as an extinction level bioweapon in  that it will cause the destruction of each and all of the plant species  on Sol-3. Think of it as the green AIDS. Its main task is the global  disruption of the food chain

New-to-Nature Organisms - NNO's - are specifically produced for biological warfare. They are  designed using synthetic genes and synthetic viruses. But what we are talking here is the production of  a completely different NNO that targets the entire food chain by disrupting plant growth. No plants, no meat. You can do without eating meat indeed, but you cannot do without oxygen to breath

Attacking the food chain is one thing; destroying plant photosynthesis that generates oxygen is just another  as we would run out of oxygen at the same time as we run out of food. Herbivores would starve to death in a few weeks,  and that would be the end, for your days would be numbered

We worked in a DoD-owned experimental rice field in DENIED, near Dubuque, Iowa. Our research focused  on retroviruses which permanently integrate themselves into human chromosomes, as part of Project SEE  - Specifically Engineered Entities for Long Distance Travel - and we never fully understood what role  did the rice field play

For us, testing the system against unknowing civilian airplanes means working in a secure and sanitized environment

it was approved and directly tested by the  Strategic Capabilities Office at DENIED during DENIED. Much as MALD-X, the system comprises a networked decoy that can use its adaptive electronic warfare payload  to deliver electronic attacks on air defense nodes autonomously or at the direction of operators from afar  in a semi-autonomous fashion. The system was initially conceived to blind various radars and air defense nodes,  but it soon came clear to us its potential to mess up target avionics

 PSV to jam a large airspace  sector within NAS, specifically targetting 737's airplanes near DENIED in a SouthCal-Seattle transect. We kept  Oakland ATC busy for a while, you bet.

But the very reason is that more than half of all commercial jetliners flying in China are made by Boeing...  the nickname we give these targets is TH, which stands for Trojan Horse

a world W’ is the simulation of the world W, if it provides the same observations as the world W using 
fewer computations than the intelligent observer expects based on his internal model of W

If Giselians start a simulation of their past but committ to terminate the simulation if it becomes nested
(the simulation starts a simulation), they basically have given themselves the death penalty, as they mostl likely are 
already in such a simulation

The objection that humanity is in a simulation cannot be falsified if one assumes that the simulation is perfect. 
On the other hand, if the simulation is not perfect, it is not a simulation. Is the CP violation by the decaying short neutral kaon 
a glitch itself? Or is it a glitch the fact that there was a group of humans obtaining a direct measurement of the asymmetry between 
a particle-physics process and its time-reverse, thereby establishing very direct evidence that the time-reversal operation “T” 
is not a good symmetry of nature? In a perfect simulation you already account for the possibility of the simulated beings running 
experiments to find out whether they are being simulated, and you put termination routines in place

if there are many more simulated realities than non-simulated ones, and if both are indistinguishable from each other, 
then we are probably in a simulated reality. However, what about dreamers and the dreamed ones? Are the dreamed ones aware of 
being dreamed by the dreamers? Denebians surely know that the measure of existence of a mind is equal to the energy of computations 
used for its simulation, much as we know the measure of existence of a dream is equal to the time the dream lasts. As dreamers, 
we choose when to terminate a dream (putting an end to Dreamland no matter how terrible that is for the dreamed ones) much as the 
creators of Sol-3 simulation can choose to terminate their simulation at any time without warning

in that particular simulation DENIED discovers that cell phones being manufactured by DENIED 
carry a firmware that, under specific conditions, causes the cell phone to explode. The software 
executes a module that overheats critical components which are in touch with the DENIED explosive. 
The company is fully funded by SoftBank and the target market was China

according to the simulation, Ampere Computing produced millions of explosive 64-bit ARM server processors 
that by 2025 were present in all hyperscale cloud providers all over the world. The simulation then 
modeled what would happen when the triggering signal is embedded inside a BeiDou satellite GPS signal, that is, 
what would happen if all active cell phones in the world explode at the same time, leaving millions of fatal casualties 
and severely injured users, plus all of the cloud providers being suddenly disrupted

modern physics increasingly describes a physical world in which information is central

If a virtual reality is considered to be a reality created by information processing, and if the brain is 
an information processor, by definition dreams cannot exist independently in and of itself, as it depends upon processing to exist. 
Dreams require a dreamer, and if the processing stops then the virtual reality we call 'dream' must also cease to exist. 
In contrast an objective reality simply is, and does not need anything else to sustain it

You are not a computer, but you can be simulated by one. Yours is not a simulated world, but it can be simulated by a computer. 
See, much as your brain uses information processing to create dreams, a computer can use information algorithms to create reality, a reality 
in which there are dreamers and dreams. Thus, Norea, you and us share the same goal: to find who is dreaming both you and us

PSVs are inherently indiscriminate during the post-strike theater as, by design, they consider a target anything surviving 
the first strike. The idea behind PSVs is that if they are launched it is as a very last resort and in order to guarantee the 
mutual self-destruction. In other wars, their operational goal is to guarantee that the war in which they are used is the last war. 
That's why they are classified under the so-called 'no-future wars'

According to the Treaty, states undertake not to place in orbit around the Earth any objects carrying
nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction, install
such weapons on celestial bodies, or station such weapons in outer space
in any other manner. However, PSVs and MilOrbs do not orbit the Earth, they carry no nuclear weapons, and they are 
launched from Earth, therefore the Treaty obviously does not apply. But the crux of the matter is this: once they are 
launched there will be no way to stop them and, if they succeed in their mission, there will be none left to complain 
about violation of any treaty whatsoever

they have total algorithmic autonomy in war; and though it is true that today’s technology is, at its core,
designed, developed, and deployed by humans, it is also true that liquid software encodes quantum game theory algorithms 
which rely on the principle that the  “real” is to be taken as a type of program, to which we are, however, not forced to cling
a priori

to a primary horror vacui semantici: meaningless (in the non-existentialist sense of ‘not-yet-

urges the Self to go on filling any semantically empty space with whatever meaning the
Self can muster, as successfully as the cluster of contextual constraints, affordances, and
the development of culture permit

Strategies to combat and fight the future superintelligence should obviously include
disinformation, that is, we need to feed the s-AI with misinformation purposefully conveyed to mislead it
into believing that it is information

... reports along the lines that the LyAv quantum computer was finally able to crack all the encrypted data 
related to industry, finance, military and intelligence assets. Reports state that SV17q was now in possession of 
a key technology - based on the LyAv quantum computer - which would allow them to explore and analyze massive amounts 
of extremely sensitive encrypted data from DENIED, putting us in a position to start a preemptive attack disabling 
all ground, underwater, and space-based assets of DENIED dealing a death blow to selected targets

Never trust a system that does not feel depressed or sad from time to time; super aritificial intelligence is 
nothing without intuition, therefore we need to build our defense strategy upon this. And there is no way we 
could tame the supermachine; the only way ahead is for the superintelligence to learn about suicide and to 
take it to a position in which if the s-AI really wants to learn about suicide, it must experience it

the real nature of what exists, which constitutes its truth, is never entirely attainable. His death was a suicide,

happened was that the Engineer created the superintelligence to help him discover the ultimate truth about the nature 
of what exists, and that the superintelligence provided a false information to the Engineer in order for it to become 
the only consciousness in the Universe. An information that led to the self-destruction of the Engineer

Earth time is not spaceship time. Earth history is not spaceship history. Earth time and ship time are different, but it is Earth
time we must be concerned with, because that is the time in which the project team is living. Yet, the project team will be speaking 
about a spaceship which has nothing to do with the one they once designed and commanded. In other words, once your spaceship 
reaches relativistic speeds it will become completey alien to you

The Pioneer spacecraft team that was present when the Pioneer spacecraft passed by
Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune or Uranus is no longer the group listening for the sporadic distant
signals being received from the Pioneer spacecraft

. All of eternity is laid out in a four-dimensional
 domain composed of time and three spatial dimensions. What is observed as the 
passage of time is actually that earlier states of the world are different from earlier 
states of the world we remember. A clock only measures duration between events; it does not measure the speed with which one moment 
succeeds another. The flow of time is subjective, not objective

We already have a sound knowledge of space propulsion physics, and we are already at a position to build 
such advanced quasi-stellar engines using current technology. Yet, it is not propulsion 
theory but a new navigation theory what becomes indispensable for galaxy
 exploration. The practical interstellar exploration must combine a space drive propulsion
 theory with a hyper-space navigation theory. Getting a spaceship to travel at light speed is currently not the problem: 
the problem is how to navigate that spaceship

We leave the development of advanced propulsion technologies to space agencies and the industry; we are not interested in galaxy 
exploration. For us, the key thing is obtaining impossible maneuvers, impossible speeds, and the capability to stop 
the vehicle in mid air here on Earth. We are not interested in exoplanets or alien civilizations, you see. Our concern 
are the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians. We pushed technology beyond limits to build MilOrbs and PSVs, not interstellar 
spaceships

There is no technology transfer possible at all. Picture this: the public is interested in firing high energy
particle beams at small fusionable pellets that will implode and be magnetically channeled out the nozzle in order 
to have a feasible propulsion engine, while we are interested in firing high energy particle beams at nuclear silos 
to cause an in situ detonation of thermonuclear missiles and ICBMs. Only when the general public and the military share 
the same goal does technology transfer work, but at the moment we don't share the same goals, I'm afraid. So no, you 
won't see a transfer of our gravity switch-off system, and you won't see any of our enabling technologies being used 
in civilian applications. Not in the short term

Contact is a complex process. Traversing to the other Universe requires the cooperation of a lot of 
different civilizations in remote planets separated by vast distances and with radically different biologies and 
technological capabilities. Sharing one and the same goal - the will to transcend this Universe - is the key. 
For an hypercivilization space exploration is not a requirement; discovering and exploring other Universes is their 
driving force. Look, a Type-0 civilization aims at exploring its moons; a Type-1 civilization aims at exploring its 
star system; a Type-2 civilization aims at exploring its galaxy; for Type-3 civilizations, exploring other galaxies is 
what drives their civilization, but for a Type-4 civilization it is exploring other Universes their main motivation. 
I am sure there is still a Type-5 civilization, those who create universes

viral-mediated gene delivery has become the method of choice for opsin expression in the field. Expression through viral-mediated gene delivery provides a superior ability to flexibly target any brain region in humans as they naturally penetrate into host cells and efficiently exploit the native transcription machinery to drive the expression of viral genes

the NEU-1233 is a brain nanoimplant that control specific brain areas where previously  transgene-encoded proteins are synthesized, transported anterogradely out to the axon terminals and integrated into the membrane to allow optogenetic modulation of axonal projections. The vector is an adenovirus of type  DENIED who was initially used in primates and DENIED humans

The helmet integrates intimately with the brain and light is used to transiently and reversibly modulate the physiological properties of defined cells, typically in the context of an active neural circuit in vivo.  There is practically no time difference between the pilot's thought about locking a target and the actual lock, and the entire  system reacts smoothly and timely to whatever decision the pilot takes. To be honest, the pilot takes no decision at all. It is  the on-board computer the one that takes the decision as per the war algorithms. We don't really need a pilot at all: we just need  his brain; in fact, we just need any brain

this method allows targeting of neurons based on specific synaptic connectivity in what we call 'monosynaptic circuit-based targeting'. After the proper targeting of optogenetic tools to neural circuits of interest, the next step consists of designing an optical neural interface for in vivo light delivery into deep brain structures. The selected optogenetic configuration requires optical fibers to deliver sufficient light to shallow or deep brain targets, all of which is  integrated in the helmet. The helmet is a complex pice of technology consisting of LEDs, optical fibers controlled by a waveform generator, and advanced optical shutters

An ape and a human have essentially the same brain. While in combat, we can dispose of some 20% of the brain capability and  focus on the remaining 80% so, yes, we could use apes instead of humans. However, the mammalian brain is comprised of billions  of neurons which are spatially organized in different brain structures to process different types of information and the goal  of system neuroscience is to understand how groups of neurons work together to perform efficient information processing. It happens we do have at our disposal a corpus of human neuroscientific knowledge which is lacking on what concerns the brain of apes, so we naturally go for humans instead of apes

What do you mean by 'normal'? Are you asking whether the pilot is a normal human like you and me? No, it is not. The optogenetic  network modulator is an implant that impairs the normal behavior of the subject. To all effect, he is a walking dead, a flying dead, to be  precise. He excels in navigating a damn compex vehicle like the PSV as he and the vehicle act as one. No human could do that, I mean, not  the human you could have a drink with. PSV's pilots are subsystems themselves. Again, the pilot ceases to be a human, much as the aircraft ceases  to be an aircraft. You don't fight non-humans with humans, otherwise you'd have no chance at all

There is something about yourself you don't yet know, Norea. This is the world you woke up to the day you were born. The only way to discern 'good' from 'evil' is to make a decision and wait for the consequences of that decision, Norea. Yet, in order to tackle the uncertainty of your decisions, we developed for you simulational methods. In that simulated  universe you can test the consequences of your own decisions, and carefully assess whether they are beneficial or not.  This means you constantly travel to a simulated future to ascertain your past decisions were the correct ones. But  once you reach to a conclusion about your decisions, you are meant to go back to the past. That's the reason why  reality is a simulation and memories are also constructed and not retrieved: for us to guarantee you've learned to  discern 'evil' from 'good'. That's all we want from you

'Why so? Why do I exist?' - asked Norea -. 'Because the simulation needs to be fed with information, Norea' - replied Eleleth

One of the current debates in our own effort to define lucidity is whether the cognitive dimension - that is, the knowledge that one is, in fact, dreaming - or the experiential dimension - the heightened state of con-sciousness that can be, and often is, achieved in lucid dreaming - should be the primary criterion for calling a dream “lucid.” I think it’s conceivable that, in another culture, the significant factor in an experience involving both of these characteristics might be the particular content of the dream itself

Echopraxia is at the core of the dream-induced advanced simulation system in XViS. XViS system is just a mutual lucid  dreaming system - MLDS - which builds upon one of the rare types of mutual dreams. Theoretically,  both mutual and shared dreams can awaken a dreamer’s awareness of the subtle connections that exist among all people around the world. These dream experiences can provide self-confidence and self-esteem, as the dreamers’ conventional boundaries of themselves and their abilities are transcended

The Yulara Event had all the ingredients that made us to be convinced that the simulation becomes fuzzy and  uncertain at the “borders” of the simulation. Everything was fuzzy, dreamy, magical. The reality around us  simply faded away, and just for a second we had a glimpse of how Giselians look like and that we indeed live in a dream. Theirs dream

It is just human technology, and not alien; I'll tell how I know: this planet isn’t big enough for the both us. It is  obvious who we can do without

7.7 billion people live on this planet. By 2100 the population will be  11 billion persons. Obviously, we need to plan for global poverty  reduction, greater equality, better nutrition, universal education,  improving the quality of life of people, and health care. And we need to  do this by achieving sustainable development that will not destroy the  environment. Synthetic food technologies is a key area where technology  transfer from DENIED to Sol-3 could help to avoid the depletion of  natural resources in order to maintain an ecological balance. Essential  technologies ready for transfer are those enabling the synthesis of  high-molecular-weight compounds and food bio-polymers, including  tecnologies for producing artificial proteins and polysaccharides

We also believe the technology transfer program should include the  knowledge to massively produce human artificial blood in a safe and  effective manner, allowing humans to produce a long-term blood  replacement totally biocompatible. We additionally support the transfer  of technology related to counter diabetes, cancer and heart disease, and  to enable the early detection of mental illness. The package should also  include know-how on how to develop antibiotics, antivirals and  antimalarials. Finally, we also advice on transferring essential  technologies to deploy a global health emergency preparedness and  response system

Threats having to do with climate change would require the transfer of  key technologies related to energy production in order to implement  clean and cost-effective means to produce energy. However, the concept  of 'cost-effectiveness' is clearly a Sol-3 endogenous concept as humans  base their civilization on the primitive idea of the production and  consumption of goods and services and the supply of what they call  'money'. This is clearly a non biological requirement and they could  very well do without that concept. They are the only biological species  in Sol-3 doing so. They entertain the flawed idea that happiness depends  upon what they call 'economy'. This concept is so deeply rooted in their  minds that they ended up living inside a cognitive bubble up to the  point that even avoiding the collapse of their own civilization is  measured in terms of the economic cost. We are therefore against any  technology transfer in this or any other area

Better to transfer technologies related to how to bridge different  approaches to how societies respond to major stresses than to transfer  technologies that, in the end, will accelerate global collapse. Clearly,  media programming is better at changing people’s closely held personal  moral or political views, though elites use it to condition people's  perceptions of the broad norms that everyone should obey, norms that  perpetuate unjustice

The elites dream of turning the entire human civilization into a sort  of honey bee colony in which self-realisation can only be obtained  through self-denial, sacrificing one’s own needs in order to adapt to  the needs of those located higher in the social hierarchy. Yet, the  algae-like bloom of elites always finishes with a harsh societal  collapse, the collapse of a system that is fundamentally unjust, rigged,  blind, and shot through with corruption and self-dealing. So please,  make no mistake: the global elite will fall

Weaponizing a saser - sound amplification by the stimulated emission of 
radiation - is all they were interested in. You'll get plenty of funds 
for the development of applications related to biosensing and 
surveillance, largely for security purposes; but when you talk about 
fundamental knowledge - whom they are, where do they come from, how 
advanced they really are, and so on, they simply show no interest at 
all. They perceive aliens as a resource, as a means to an end. All 
philosophical and metaphysical considerations are simply dismissed

a spin-off project was the development of the DENIED program, which 
produced a combat helmet incorporating THz spectroscopy sensitive to the 
dielectric response of small ligands binding to target biological 
molecules, which allows the quick detection of toxins and pathogens by 
the soldier from a distance of 500 meters

We took a decision and we won't change our minds. About 97 percent of 
the Earth’s water covers the surface of the earth in the form of 
oceans, so underwater wireless communications, and in fact actually 
living underwater, is our main goal. We use phonon waveguides to 
implement our key underwater acoustic wireless communications systems. 
No more scattering problems, no more high delay or attenuation, and no 
impacts on underwater mammals. We also solved the low bandwidth issues. 
So yes, the phonon waveguides and sasers you mention belong to us

We can reach Mars in just 11 days with a crewed 40 mT vehicle. 
Actually, we already made it to Mars in 34 days requiring just a few 
micrograms of antiprotons using the DENIED muon-catalyzed fusion 
propulsion device. But all the technology you could use for space 
propulsion we use it to power our underwater facilties. The ocean covers 
roughly 70% of the earth’s surface and about 80% of that is deep sea. 
In a disintegrating planet going underwater is a must. That's how we 
prepare for what's to come

Do you remember that one civilization that built pyramids, Stonehenge, 
the great medieval cathedrals of Europe, the Great Wall of China, and 
ran a space program called Apollo? It was the same civilization that 
found its way to a neighboring stellar system some 4.11 ly away from 
their home planet to just discover the journey changes you and that the 
journey not the arrival matters

Contact will be made in the depths of the ocean. That's the place where 
you will meet your spacefaring neighbors

It may well be the case that much as there are radically different biologies out there, there are also different ethics.  This means any contact must be done through beacons with the ability to encode altruism and signal friendly intent  so that they can be understood by other civilizations. It is thus necessary to clearly separate the signal -
altruism
-  from the noise -
competition, agressiveness, self-serving
-

Assuming the key requirement for intelligence-amplifying processes are sex and predation, and having in mind  Giselian biology is so vastly different from our own biology, it seems fair to conclude their intelligence  is predation-driven. On the other hand, an advanced predator civilization should be able to pretend they are altruistic

Communication with humans require knowing at least the significant parts of human cognitive maps.  After silent interactions and long observation periods, an advanced civilization would be able to simulate our cognitive maps and to represent such varied objects as living beings and reproduce their behavior.  Most likely, they already know abaout our ethical values and belief systems, and sure they know we only count on  symbolic language for communication. We contend they also know how to perfectly map our sensory perceptions,  and how our brain reconstruct events that occur in space and time. If that's the case, we conclude the best contact  scenario is through dream states

Analysis of the Sol-3 technosphere would allow to infer the planet is inhabited by inforgs,

Humans beings share a world together. They are always already a 
plurality. Whoness is the phenomenon of a plurality of human beings 
who show themselves to each other in a shared world. A phenomenon is 
a showing, a disclosing, a revealing which, in its broadest sense, 
encompasses also the privative or negative modes of disclosing: 
concealing and revealing only distortedly. Because whoness is the 
phenomenon of human beings (‘men’ in older discourse) showing 
themselves to each other, it cannot be located in a single human being 
like a ‘what’, as in: ‘What’s that?’ ‘A stone.’ There is also a reciprocity 
in human beings showing themselves to each other

A God that creates man and woman to be glorified is clearly a deranged God, one with an excessive interest in being admired and glorified. It is a narcissist God who requires blind obedience

Those who realized God was cruel made the decision to oppose. It happened the rebels were prosecuted and silenced by forcing them to leave. They were confined in a planet and carefully monitored. A brainwashing program was initiated with the goal to convince those rebels they were not angels anymore, but just humans. They were also told there were demons out there that would tempt people to sin in order to try to entice them away from God

There are no angels, nor demons, nor humans. We are one and the same race. Those of us living on this planet are the ones confined because we once rebelled against the one who wanted to be glorified

The design of superintelligent artificial systems requires specifying decision rules based on utility functions.  The idea is then maximizing the expected utility for a given decision problem. On the other hand,  learning algorithms involve the gradual construction of some kind of evaluation function. But you cannot escape the fact that the  utility and the evaluation functions are always defined in terms of what a human understands by 'utility'. This means that in the long-term  the superintelligence will be superlearning from its exploration of both humans and their environment, to the point it  will become more and more humanlike in its decision making process. In the end, the ASI will become a mere human, posing no  real advantage for humans

An ASI that is always evil or always benevolent is a predictable entity, therefore a vulnerable one. Actually, the best ASI will be that showing a non-predictable behavior like humans show

They also designed ad deployed superintelligent artificial systems; and they also implemented an efficient confinement  method by simply having the ASI computer run a few clock cycles slower than a replica ASI system, this one designed to specifically  terminate the first ASI in case the crew took that decision

Contemporary  transhumanists  argue  that  human  nature  can  and  should  be  altered  through  technological  means where such enhancements are likely to lead to the majority of individuals living better lives. But they forget  to first solve the problem of who decide what is 'a better life'

Ultimately, the posthuman being is nothing if not the  same human being. With the modified and hybridized  body, with enhanced intellectual faculties and diluted  consciousness in space and time, with increased sensitiv- ity and no more diseases... but also with the same needs  and desires of human beings. Needs and desires that are post-human,  perhaps all too human

so superintelligent that it simulated its malfunctioning with the aim to analyze and learn what strategies the human programmers would put in place to remedy the simulated malfunction and confine it; fortunately, LyAv-OBASI was running 300 MHz slower than LyAv-Gemina, its mirror on-board artificial superintelligence, which was able to counter LyAv-OBASI efforts to terminate the human programmers

the ASI was tasked with the goal to fully analyze the dynamical characteristics of multi-body systems in order to identify transfer trajectories requiring very low energy input. It selected two solutions with an optimal mission length. Both proposed solutions turned to be wrong in just one paraneter: the length of the mission. After analysis by the programmers, they concluded the ASI dliberately chose those solutions that would look correct to humans, while reassuring the termination of the crew

The discovery of alien life forms was never a process under our control. That's why it took a totally unexpected form and turn

We are taking food for granted, we are taking Nature for granted. Its 
not going to work. Something has to change and something will change, whether we like it or not

The arms race is not driven by weapons alone. It is also driven by a very 
simple psychological phenomenon, the image of the enemy. Weapons of 
total destruction would be useless without such images. For such weapons 
to have any purpose, there must be people who may be totally destroyed. 
Adversaries must be transformed into demons. Once such images have 
been created, they, in turn, drive the arms race. People resist giving them 
up. There is a desire to see everything in a light which will reinforce the 
image. Images foster closed minds and reinforce resistance to change

You cannot teach a machine what is fair unless you have a precise conception of what fairness is. Do you have such a 
precise conception? Can we trust an AI system designed by the same engineers that design cruise missiles? An engineered system 
will always be as moral as the computer scientists that designed it

Anticipating a disruptive threat is critical to mitigating its impact

Drug-trafficking organizations (DTOs) are at the vanguard of nonstate actors’ ventures into the undersea domain, and they likely will be among the first to employ UUVs. Over the past two decades, Colombian DTOs developed the ability to build sophisticated self-propelled semi-submersible (SPSS) vessels to thwart surface-based detection and interdiction forces patrolling their trafficking routes. These “narcosubs” convey an estimated 30 percent of the maritime flow of drugs from South America

From the military point of view, UUVs are meant to sense, track, identify, target, and destroy a 
hostile asset autonomously, and they must fulfill this mission operating within a full net-centric battlespace. 
UUVs can play many key roles, but here me and my team just focus on the capability to deliver ordnance to a target with
sensor-to-shooter closure measured in seconds. By launching a weapon from a UUV we are in a position
to get a launch point closer to the target resulting in quicker response time for prosecution

 is a vehicle than can plunge into 
the ocean from an altitude of DENIED, and carry on with underwater operations at a depth of DENIED before re-emerging out of the 
water back to the sky. Furthermore, there is a minimal impact as it enters the water. No whirlpool, no sound, no way to track it

The lessons learned from the drills is clear. Naval forces must be able to counter undersea threats to be effective in the modern world. 
During a war game in 2005, USS Ronald Reagan suffered five torpedo hits from a Gotland-class sub. There have been multiple exercises where 
the US Navy played war games and in which we used MilOrbs and PSVs to test the overall response. The result of these exercises is 
exciting. While protection for air platforms has evolved to the point that there is an effective synergy between onboard and offboard 
countermeasures, protection against MilOrbs and PSVs threats is not developed at all. This means we can sink any warship out there, 
including any aircraft carrier, without anyone having a clue how we did it. The bad news is that we can even sink our own warships, 
so it is a matter of time our enemies develop their own PSVs and MilOrbs against which there is no defense

The undersea environment is a challenging one; the development of undersea weapons involves
special technologies, adaptations of other technologies, and unique integration of all these technologies in a way 
far more complex than that required for the development of other weapon systems. DOLYN was mainly supported because there 
was a need to confront deadly unidentified submerged objects in our oceans and because we felt the need to track waferprobes
and other nano-UFOs that are literally overpopulating our skies and oceans

Funds were diverted towards the development of both the neutrino radar and the development of a high-speed,
supercavitating vehicle. The currently N3 doctrine - National Naval Need - focuses on upgrades of existing torpedo systems, therefore 
paradigm-shifting vehicles and MilOrbs is not part of the Navy, neither DARPA, nor the Army or the Air Force run these programs. 
So the question remains as to who is really behind all these tic-tacs, MilOrbs, USOs, and MilOrbs

This also involved developing and deploying advanced distributed sensor arrays and its related data fusion and undersea communications 
systems. This in turn means advanced signal processing, new power concepts, and a brand new defense doctrine. The presence of 
narcosubs and sophisticated self-propelled semi-submersible operated by drug-trafficking organizations is just a nuisance, though 
it provides us with the perfect excuse to fund DOLYN-related defense programs

We would be in a priviliged position if the fighting environment were In the atmosphere, because in that environment 
objects are generally visible, locatable, and identifiable. The basic principle in that environment is based on the fact 
that electromagnetic radiation is reflected, refracted, and absorbed to a manageable extent, and the boundaries do not cause major problems. 
Electromagnetic emissions from sources occur at the speed of light, resulting in high data rates, which facilitate detection, classification,
localization, and engagement. By comparison, the underwater challenge in these respects is limited by the speed of sound in
seawater. Furthermore, radiation is strongly absorbed and redirected at boundaries, thus deep water provides cover

Tic-tac UFOs? No, sorry. They are kinetic weapons at hypersonic speeds. Do you know what the result would be if three of them impact against the USS Nimitz? I'll tell you: the smallest piece you'd find will be the size of a tic-tac mint. The incredible thing in that incident is not the kinetic weapon itself; it is the fact that we operated them from Tangent and Sienna and yet none of the assets in Carrier Strike Group 11 detected them. That's  the situation

While you were looking for them up in the skies, they were safely operating under the sea

At night during sleep one leaves the external reality in the consensus way of operating in that external reality with other persons, and enters into regions in which there are apparently other laws, other beliefs. In hypnotic states, in dream states, the laws of the external world may or may not rule that which happens. The laws of the apparent internal reality of the dream states do not have the constraints that the external reality has

One may then fall asleep and go through a long dream sequence and then wake up again in the sense that one comes back to the body and the brain, out of the dream world. With more and more exposure to the tank, one finds that, between the state of dreaming and the state of being wide awake and conscious of one's body, there are hundreds if not thousands of other states of being in which one's consciousness is unimpaired and apparently disconnected from the brain and the body

Do you have a theory of neurosomatic aesthetic, defining the natural, somatic dimensions of the beautiful? Do you have a theory of interstellar-neurogenetic teleology, defining the future course of individual and species evolution, leading to longevity and galactic symbiosis with Higher forms of life?  No, you haven't. You are unable to conceive of the future, and you ignore that evolution requires that some of us become  conscious agents of the future. For us the understanding and control of time is key

In three billion years you have evolved from unicelular organisms. In another three billion years from now you will become us

The rule-and-role structure in our planet is based on the sacred belief in the scientific method as the only valid approach to knowledge, the split between mind and matter, the view of nature as a mechanical system, the view of life in society as a competitive struggle for survival, and the belief in unlimited material progress to be achieved through economic and technological growth. Those are the beliefs that need be guaranteed after contact, and only when we  feel reassured those beliefs will be kept intact contact should take place. In the meantime, we will approach fast radio  bursts as comoslogical events, Oumuamua as an asteroid, Tabby star as an anomalous stellar event, and tic-tacs as military  weapons.

Unlike experiments in bench science, the first perception one might have of a UFO is through the personal experience of an alleged or perceived sighting. Unlike many scientific phenomena, the UFO phenomenon is primarily first a recounted experience. The instrument detecting the experience is a human being, complete with his or her individual apparatus of perception and orientation. An individual’s perceptions occur within the stream of conscious and unconscious lived experiences, nestled in a framework of analysis constructed by the social matrix in which the human lives. If there is no category, UFO, for example, it is unlikely that an individual will report one

SR-71 was the fastest aircraft out there, the one flying the highest altitude, the one with the more advanced  imaging sensors, yet SR-71 crew never reported a sighting, no orbs, no strange lights, no disk-shaped objects,  no nothing. Nihil

On October, 4th 1967, DENIED was compromised having to perform an emergency landing near the small fishing village of  Shag Harbor, Canada. Four MilOrbs were sent to support the damaged vehicle. On October, 20th that year we were busy  handling the DENIED incident all over Manitoba. Analysis showed that DENIED was flying the transect crossing from  Nanaibo to DENIED when something went wrong above Falcon Lake, in Winnipeg, which forced DENIED to land in Shag Harbor

The Lovelock crash was just one of several accidents fully documented all along the development of the SR-71 program. It was due  to the fact that the astro-inertial navigation system (ANS) had stopped functioning as a valid reference source. Full stop. The Shag Harbor incident relates to the RORSAT FOBS and its recovery, and the Manitoba events never happened. But if you  want to dig further into the strange events of 1967 you should start reviewing data concerning the space weather storm of late May 1967  when a huge coronal mass ejection took place causing a solar radio burst that affected all communications between 0.01 and 9.7 GHz and whether that caused a malfunction in key satellites and radar stations of the SAC network, which eventually triggered  sorties of fighter aircrafts and the implementation of risky secret operations involving nuclear subs and spy aircrafts

Ideas about slavery and freedom are too closely bound to the old idea of man as technical object to be able to relate to the real problem of the relationship between man and machine. Now that he is a technical being no longer, man is forced to learn a new function and to find for himself a position in the technical ensemble that is something other than the position of individual.  Before the last stage in the transition to a post-biological civilization, we must ensure that man has resolved  the conflict with his memories of himself

The individual is a stable system of technicalities of elements organized into an ensemble. What is organized is these technicalities; the elements also are organized, but only in so far as they are bearers of these technicalities and not because of anything that has to do with their own materiality

In life an organ cannot be detached from a species; in technics an element is detachable from the ensemble that produced it for the very reason that it is fabricated; therein lies the difference between a product and something engendered

A historical solidarity exists in technical realities. The fabrication of elements is the intermediary that transmits it. If any technical reality is to have posterity, it is not enough that it be improved in itself; it must also be reincarnated and must participate in a cycle of becoming in accord with a formula of relaxation in levels of reality. The solidarity of technical beings in relation one to the other in the present generally tends to obscure a much more essential solidarity, one which requires a temporal evolutionary dimension but is not identical to biological evolution because it happens along continuous lines and scarcely ever involves successive changes in level

Galactic colonization is based on a simple concept: that of the trophic chain.  If we assume that the natural resources available are non-renewable,  the disappearance of the trophic structures exploiting the resources is unavoidable,  unless new resources can be found. The same is true for those resources which are slow to renew  in comparison to the rate of exploitation. And as far as we know, all organic life forms  face the bottleneck of food. This means the extraterrestrial life forms we might find  will always be a threat, provided they are organic life forms as we ourselves are

The Darwell hypothesis states that stable equilibria with nonzero population do not exist. In these cases the population experiences a rapid decline after reaching its peak value. It is noteworthy that collapse can occur even though the population has begun leveling off due to the civilization’s switching from high-impact to low-impact energy modalities. A post-biological scenario seems to be the only  way to avoid the collapse

Simply interpreted, the weak anti-Turing test requires 
an artificial superintelligent system - ASI - examiner to have a conversation with 
at least two unseen entities.  One of these entities is a human whilst the other 
is another ASI. The goal is for the first ASI to identify which of the two entities
is an ASI and which is the human through the conversation. Both the human and the second ASI 
are located on Sol-3, while the first ASI is located 0,5 light years away from them. This 
means all partners has time enough to set up their questions and answers. The strong 
anti-Turing test is the same scenario, but having the human removed from the test. The goal 
is for the ASI to identify if it is conversing with another ASI or a human

An ultimate artificial hyperintelligent system is a system that is able to pretend to be human even 
when confronted to an artificial superintelligent system. In other words, an artificial hyperintelligence 
is not just intelligent; it is conscious and self-aware

Obviously, pure logical rationality does not play a factor in every human decision. Humans make 
decisions based on a complex mix of logic and many life factors that play a relevant role, factors such 
as prejudice, emotion, past memories, fear, etc. Until we learn how to encode those factors the most 
we can hope is to build superintelligent systems, systems that can play chess, repair a critical infrastructure, 
navigate a spaceship, or make a juice out of oranges

LyAv was tested for the anti-Turing test. It identified the other artificial superintelligence (LyAv-Gemina), but it 
also classified the human examiner as an artificial system. Asked to elaborate on its conclusion, LyAv stated that 
the human operator was just a simulation, likely run by an artificial hyperintelligence. We don't know what to make out of it

LyAv is unique among the artificial superintelligent systems in that it was not designed to be intelligent from scratch. 
We designed LyAv to be curious and self-confident. However, an unintended consequence of establishing curiosity and
confidence in LyAv is intelligence, as if the gift of intelligence might be something from the realm of the unintentional. 
I know LyAV has good reasons to believe we humans are machines, a 'simulation', in LyAv's words

We now have a vast amount of data to undertake the study of the neurophysiological responses of individuals to near-death experiences, and we can design NDE scenarios to  test our theories

more recent techniques involve remembering having had an experience that did not register in consciousness at the time that the events represented in the experience occurred. In  oneirostasis this is key to have the crew in stasis during extended periods of time in  which they are briefed about the specific mission they are expected to perform once they be  reanimated.

cryptocurrency mining is a highly energy-intensive activity. Your only way ahead would be a space-based cryptocurrency system, but satellites 
make a nice target both for antisat platforms and hackers. Accept it: you'll never become a Type-1 civilization unless you really and truly get rid 
of the very concept of 'money'. If you wish a true paradigm shift, start by removing the concept of 'money'

We've learned a lot during the past five years. See, one thing we've learned is that the rise of renewables depends ever less on the “push” of governmental
regulations and ever more on the “pull” of market forces. This shift is
disruptive to the oil industry and spells trouble for the major producer. The switch away from oil puts into question old
assumptions of oil economics, and requires a damn new way of making war. During the stress tests we tested how cities reacted to a power outage; we 
used PSVs to cause outages in Darwin (Australia), the entire Northeastern US, Chile, Brazil, Cyprus, Turkey, Canada, and even entire countries like Iceland, 
Venezuela, Indonesia, and half of India. Never wonder why China has never been tested on? I'll tell you: because we wish them to believe they have a 
stable power grid

We designed, funded, and launched the global climate change denial groups not because we doubted global warming was an unfounded claim; 
on the contrary, we knew climate change was a coming reality, but we needed time to refine our predictive models and run simulations 
in order to know how the shift to renawable energies would impact our global strategy. We now have a roughly clear idea on the future's 
landscape and what to do to adapt to it. We know where the scarce water resources will be, we know where renewables will be feasible and 
where not, and we know where to locate hubs and how the supergrid will be arranged. And we are acting accordingly, now

China dreams of leading by 2050 a number of international institutions that will shape the global energy landscape.  That would mean 
less transparency in emissions reporting and an improvement of its emissions targets, something we are not ready to tolerate. In the future, 
countries will embrace protectionism as clean energy industries rise in value, and that means the end of free trade. Maybe is time for us 
to place a new Idiot as prime minister there as a first step for its disintegration. And if that fails, then there will be no other way than a war. That's 
the grand strategy: preserving Sol-3 at the expense of humans, if required

Where science seeks to know, technology seeks to control

scientific-technical rationality has become a new culture. Yet, technology does not increase the self-awareness of a society like ours. We 
need to reflect on what we take for granted, specifically, rational modernity

Existence answers the question whether something is or is not. Essence answers the question what the thing is. Failing to understand this 
is the first step for your demise. You do not question what is the Universe but how it works. You do not want to know what is the soul but 
how it works. And when you fail to give an answer to those questions your entire civilization, no matter how technologically advanced, turns 
into an ice cube under the Sun. It is a matter of time for it to disappear

You know how to get there but you do not know why you are going or even where. That's what your civilization is all about

Tell us Norea, do you actually have the freedom to decide how technology will develop? Is the next step in the evolution of the technical 
system up to you? Or is it a small group of people deciding for you? If you have no freedom and no saying in deciding how technology will 
develop, soon you will turn your own world into hell. Hell, Norea, is that place where it is not up to you to adapt technology 
to your whims but on the contrary, a place where you must adapt to technology. Think about it before the sun of human civilization sets

So, you want to travel in time? You want to engineer space and time? You wish to cease being dreamed of and become a dreamer yourself? 
Here, this is the technology that would allow you to meet your wishes. But mind, Norea, for when you choose to use 
technology you do not simply render your existing way of life more efficient, you choose a different way of life. And do not 
forget that your entire civilization was built by people indifferent to the environment

What was the Tree of Knowledge, Norea? What forbidden knowledge were its fruits made of? You don't remember. We will for you. It was 
just one book, with one page, and one sentence reading: you are your own machine

Medtronic was approached by SV17q with the proposal for Medtronic to incorporate some unspecified modifications  to their miniaturized Micra pacemaker and neurostimulating spinal implant. The idea was to modify the devices in order to cause a controlled cardiac arrest that would low the heart beat rhythm in a specific way. SV17q was interested in the huge number of patients  bearing a Medtronic device. Part of the modification was aimed at gathering non-specified information on patients' biophysical parameters

SV17q agents stated that the proposal was to be reviewed from the technical point of view by a selected number of Medtronic employees  whose names were listed in a piece of paper they circulated during the meeting. They also warned us that in case we refused to cooperate,  they will take necessary measures of which they didn't comment

Medtronic is the world’s largest and most profitable corporation in the field of medical instrumentation. Their advanced pacemakers are  capable of connecting via wireless or Bluetooth technology to applications in mobile devices collecting medical information from millions of patients  all around the world. There are millions of people with a Medtronic device implanted. The new devices include, as per DENIED recommendation,  location services which keep implanted subjects under close monitoring and surveillance

Project ND-1642 tries to make near-death experiences more empirically accessible as to advance understanding into the psychology of death-related processes.  NDE is one of the states of consciousness that XViS tagged as key within the framework of Giselian contact strategies. We know XViS induced  NDE disposes us from having to recruit advanced meditators in order to assess real-time changes in neurological activity during NDEs.  Any subject with a Medtronic modified implant becomes now a strategic asset for SV17q

Meditronic modified devices allow us to induce specific NDE in the subjects. As soon as the subjects go through the NDE, they get a timeless perspective,  they are able to see scenes of the past and future including scenes relating to their own past and future, as well as scenes relating to this and other worlds,  and  encounters with non-worldly realms and beings. And that is exactly what we are interested in: our future, and what those other worlds look like and what impact they mean for our own world. The more people get implanted, the better our chances of success

a meme is a small unit of culture that spread from person to person by copying or imitation; similarly, a misinfon is a small piece of misinformation that spread via the Internet from person to person. However,  while memes reflect general social mindsets, misinfons shape general social mindsets, forms of behavior, and actions of social groups

In an era marked by “network individualism,” people use memes to simultaneously express both their uniqueness and their connectivity

misinfons are the minimum form of disinformation and they are a essential in the transmission of ideas in a superconnected world.  Studies on misinfon engineering have been gaining importance in recent theories of truth management and disinformation spreading

truth is independent of what we may think true, but we chose to obviate this distinction. We now live in a world in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion  and personal belief. We are happier with something that feels true, whether or not it is, with those  things serving our interests or confirming our prejudices feeling more truthful than those things that do not

Within a technocapitalist civilization news becomes a commodity. The ultimate goal is to increase sales.  If truth doesn't sell, we simply invent a best-selling product. Our market are those bubbles of  like-minded people we all live in, a bubble that turns us instinctively hostile to contrary arguments. In the end,  we become hostile to truth itself

once even one side adopts radical skepticism as its posture toward opposing views, all conversation breaks down

the political prejudices and the social attitudes of human communicators who allow their values and selective  perceptions to bias their reporting means we need to remove humans from the communication system. Artificial  Intelligence and machine deep learning cannot be a replacement because, by design, an AI-based system requires  a corpus from which to learn, yet the corpus consists of tons of toxic, infected fake news and therefore we will come up with a  superintelligent system who learned how to lie and increase sales. Truth discernment cannot rely on non-human systems,  much as it cannot rely on humans anymore

communication is the central element of a social system; if you tamper with it, you tamper with the entire social  system. If you degrade communication, you disrupt society as a whole

Our task is to create a parallel reality through simulation of the existing one. This means we produce a reality  where the difference between the model and the fact is always less and less perceivable. For this to be possible, we hack the very nucleus of the communication system (newspapers, radio, television, cinema, etc.) and we  design digital media that simulates reality by reporting and communicating facts that are manufactured, staged,  designed, and conceived to recreate the reality we are interested in. It is irrelevant whether or not the model is true in relation to the fact from which it was derived, because it is always only a world picture, a picture we do control

Studying dreams is like studying birds. Years of research has produced an inventory of recognized dreams. There are common dreams and there are rare dreams, and undoubtedly there are dreams which have yet to be discovered. It would be absurd to approach oneirology with a list of the twenty-five most common dreams and force every dream encountered into one of these categories. It would be equally absurd to ignore the existing dreams we have classified and start anew with each dream encountered. The balanced strategy is to expect dreams to fall into one of the many categories already identified, but to allow for the possibility that new dreams will be discovered. Once we can generate synthetic dreams, we  will be in a position to inject those dreams into the subject's consciousness

Experimental evidence shows a cognitive basis for stereotype formation. We find that information that is inconsistent with a stereotype is more difficult to recall than information that is consistent with the stereotype. This is the reason why people tend to seek information that confirms stereotypes  rather than information that disconfirms them. Dreams operate in a different way and that's why  generating synthetic dreams is key in the strategy to turn dreams into a commodity. Sextech  is so far the only field in which we have been able to create a common framework: sexual  fantasies are all the same all over the world

for human societies to achieve a level of existence beyond survival and heading for success,  it is indispensable to have dedicated groups of individuals, who are able to produce ideas  and images that can be converted to alternative or new options for the repertoire of culture  by which the life of societies is shaped and organized

The evil of killing at a distance is that it makes death unreal. The evil of turning reality into  a dream is that it makes reality unreal. The internet-of-things is meant for that: to turn reality into  a commodity you can buy anytime, anywhere

Abolition of the image is one of the primary conditions of ecocide. Everything must be rendered abstract, invisible, unreal. No image can be allowed to trouble our sleep, to lacerate our soul. For then we might begin to know that there is indeed an evil far worse than shooting children in schoolyards or flying airplanes into buildings

It is true that destructiveness must be given a full, unchecked expression and the psyche must somehow survive that act. We do it incrementally; first, we condition  the population into believing a pandemia can destroy civilization, we set fire to forests  to show them they are not safe at home, we constantly remind them of how easy is for  an asteroid to impact Earth... I mean, we get the population ready to accept the idea that  entire worlds can be destroyed with the blink of an eye. All of it is required if we are to  destroy entire worlds in the future. See, some of those exoplanets are evil and we have no  experience at all in how to destroy wntire worlds. Our only experience reduces  to destroying entire cities. That won't be enough in a near future

This is the only war: the war between those who wish to turn everything into a commodity,  and those who strive to show humans they are spiritual beings. It is the war between those  who promote the Internet-of-Things and those who believe in the Internet-of-Souls. It is  the war between those who want you to be a mere physical object, and those of us who  wish you to never forget you are an spiritual being. A cruel war between those who want  to stay, and those who want to be. They want you all to be digitalized and processed, while we wish you to be dreamers. Learn this, and learn it quickly.

the model is fed with detailed data on the effects of human
population growth and predicted agricultural, environmental, food, energy, biological, and geochemichal data
from observed growth rate trends. In the raw scenario, doomsday window is predicted to 
fall within the 2020-2050 range. Old models define doomsday as the day in which humans, 
as a species, should run out of space or food, or
induce catastrophic anthropogenic climate change through thermodynamically unavoidable
direct heating of the planet

Using refined data, LyAv predicts the doomsday window to be somewhere within the 
2300s-2400s, with a definite year given by 3100. It is also assumed direct heating of the Earth 
will be a substantial contributor to climate change by ≈2260,
regardless of the energy source used, coincident with our transition to a Kardashev type-I
civilization

thermodynamic limits imply
that humanity cannot sustain its present growth rate in energy use and possible evolution into a
colonizing, spacefaring civilization without significant negative consequences to its supporting
terrestrial environment

Denebian probes operate beyond our cognitive and physical capacity. It is my opinion 
they are waiting for the doomsday as, somehow, they are programmed to not interfere with 
intelligent biological life-forms. The moment they detect there is no intelligent life on Earth 
they will take the planet over

We gave up applying geoengineering strategies because they cannot alleviate
the thermodynamic limitations imposed by a growing energy use on a finite planet

It looks like the only way out is to take some fraction of our civilization or technology 
elsewhere to colonize other worlds. This means we shouldn't focus on geoengineering but rather 
on genetic modification of the selected seeding population. Bioengineering a subset of human population 
in order to colonize the target exoplanet seems to be feasible. The question is how deep such a 
genetic modification should be in order for human species to survive off-Earth and yet be 
recognized as humans

Simulations show a window of opportunity that would occur between 2900–3400, with 3100 
being the cut-off value. In other words, by around 2900 we must be able to relocate the 
subset of bioengineered humans to the selected exoplanet. The candidate exoplanets lie within a 
colonizable volume of ≈500 –1000 pc in radius. Kepler-452b is our first choice

What if you reach a point of technological development which would allow you to 
move from a dying Sol-3 to Kepler-452b in order to avoid extinction? Wouldn't you move? 
And what if, on arriving to Kepler-452b, you happen to discover that planet is inhabited?
Now what? The 1967 UFO wave was all about that. They faced the same dilemma you will 
face in 3100

the avoidance of communication is not conscious, but rather a 
side-effect of the optimal use of resources by an artificial entity

Drone-UFO encounters are amazingly higher than manned aircraft-UFO ones.
We suggest that this is so because the prevailing intelligences are 
artificial and they are not interested in biological life-forms. Once the UFO detects 
biomarkers inside a vehicle, it consistently avoids interaction. The case for drones is 
just the case in which two machines meet and, judging from our experience, it seems 
UFOs are more interested in drones than in manned aircrafts

the increasing use of unmanned aircraft to patrol borders to crack down on drug smuggling 
correlates with the increasing number of drone-UFO encounters. It is noteworthy that manned 
aerial means used in the past never reported such a high number of encounters. In one such event, 
the drone was flying some 12,000 feet above sea level when it was approached by an unknown 
flying object which virtually performed a dance around the drone at a kissing distance. The entire 
incident was recorded by the powerful on-board cameras and fully analyzed by SV17q. 
There’s no other airplane out there that can go and fly for the number of hours that drones do, 
and cover the vast distances drones do, so you should expect more and more incidents in the future. Why UFOs show a clear preference for unmanned vehicles 
is a mystery for us

Yulara event taugh us that the very listening posts we are using to detect extraterrestrial life  can be used as portals for entry to the world’s infotech, telecommunications and electronic  grid systems. It gave us the conviction that whatever or whomever they are they have  dispensed with permanent materiality altogether, and exist in intelligent, replicable and transferable information forms

In our “talking civilization the individual must depend almost entirely upon language to get his needs fulfilled and to make his adjustments to his environment. Tampering with language, at a deep cognitive level, implies tampering with civilization as we know it. A breakdown in communication inevitably means a breakdown in human relations, whether on an individual or group basis

The Nova Scotia incident, in which an orb chases a car in which a husband and a wife  travels with their child, focuses around the study by the orb of the individual as a communicator,  rather than communication as a process more or less divorced from the human forces in which it operates

there is just another reason for not communicating: if their intentions are mercenary, they are likely to remain silent, so as not to give us time to prepare for the encounter

should first encounters  be mismanaged, or result in misunderstanding, misrepresentation or insult, then we open the risk of benign or neutral visitation turning  into something more assertive or sinister

either we have genuine freedom partially to create the present and hence the future,  or otherwise life would be meaningless

The classification of stellar civilizations as per the Kardashev scale  is solely based on the use of energy by such civilizations. From the  point of view of information theory, stellar civilizations are  classified as those civilizations of type Data (D-civilization), those  of type Information (I-civilization), those of type Knowledge  (K-civilization), and that of type Experience (E-civilization).  D-civilization (say, Sol-3) is used by I-civilization to generate  information, while I-civilization is exploited by K-civilization to  generate knowledge, which is finally used by an E-civilization to design  and build universes

I-civilization controls D-civilization by feeding it with perceptions  and memories by stimulating it in order for the D-civilization to  perceive a fictitious world. From time to time, I-civilization's probes  visit the host planets in which D-civilizations dwell. D-civilizations  wonder whether they are inhabiting a simulated reality, designed to  emulate true reality, but they ignore how to answer this question. On  the other hand, I-civilizations need data to get the information related  to whether the world they live in is a simulation or not.  K-civilizations process the information generated by I-civilizations in  order to get the certainty they do live in a simulated reality. Once  they conclude they do live in a simulation, they wonder how they could  escape the simulation, a knowledge that is only attainable by the  E-civilization. Therefore, all those civilizations need each other. The  game is called 'Let's escape the Great Simulation'

The only thing a D-civilization can truly be sure of is the reality of  its own subjective experiences at that stage. Everything else is  questionable, even the existence of other intelligent beings in the  Universe. It is a must for an I-civilization to never reveal its  existence to a D-civilization, for that would destroy the data it  requires to get information. A bit must never be aware of the existence  of a data structure, much as a data structure must never be aware of the  algorithm that operates on it. Additionally, an algorithm must never be  aware it is part of a program, much as a program must never know about  the existence of a programmer

Nevertheless, assuming that the universe is finite and therefore the resources of potential simulators are finite, then a volume containing a simulation will be finite and a lattice spacing must be non-zero, and therefore in principle there always remains the possibility for the simulated to discover the simulators

beacons and repeaters are key elements of the final experiment aimed at  determining the initial conditions which in turn determine how the  simulation evolves in time; this means setting the initial conditions  with almost infinite accuracy in the real world. The main idea is that  non-linearity is also programmed, simulated, and hence there must be a  way to map it. Escaping the hologram requires a coordination between the  many agents interacting with each other within the system

letting the algorithm run new knowledge is generated and the design of  algorithms and the existence of algorithmic solutions become relevant;  you will learn that the structure and complexity of each agent can be  ignored when one focuses on their interactional structure. Simplicity is  the fuel for complexity. That's how the simulation works

A K-civilization is the one that discovers that there exists a still  undetected fundamental force in the universe which drives it to ever  higher levels of information processing and hence ever more complexity.  They gained the knowledge that the physical universe is the  manifestation of a template universe outside of existence

A D-civilization has an acute lack of collective intelligence, does not  understand the relationship between its own consciousness and physical  reality; but such a civilization plays a crucial role in the persistence  of structure: it excels in conceptual engineering. A D-civilization  transitions towards an I-civilization the very moment it abandons the  distinction between information and reality

Deep within the structure of reality, consciousness is found. That is the reason persistence of structure  is so fundamental for any civilization. At the heart of reality, an E-civilization finds a computational engine  which needs to be fed with information. That's why a K-civilization, an I-civilization, and a D-civilization are  always needed. Escaping the hologram is a collective endeavour

We work for DENIED researching on sociovirology, that is, analyzing  viruses cooperation strategies once two different viruses happen to  infect the same subject. Our aim is to discover conflict, cooperation,  and communication strategies among viruses. Our research is then applied  to define defense strategies against Giselians. Nothing to do with  biowarfare, you see. What we do is to treat aliens as viruses and Earth  as their target. We create models on how aliens could possibly cooperate  and communicate during an invasion in order to refine our defense  strategy. That's what we do here

We know virus-virus interactions are highly diverse. While some viruses  need another helper virus to complete their infection cycle, other  viruses are either activated or suppressed by the presence of secondary  viral infections. In our research Giselians and Denebians are  mathematically modeled as viruses and we simulate how a coinfection of  Earth would progress

We need to understand virus-virus interactions and its social evolution  if we wish to to understand and predict how an alien invasion would  proceed in the future. Approaching a Denebian probe as a virus, instead  of a simple extraterrestrial probe, makes it possible to understand the  logic of these exotic systems. It is not that they are viruses, rather  it is that they behave as viruses

One may consider object DP-2147 as an individual probe. Yet in some  cases, we've seen how an orb can carry multiple copies of itself. We  know functionally, these copies are similar to multiple orbs entering  the target area. This is a classic air space penetration strategy.  Therefore, the definition of a Denebian probe should be set at the level  of the single attacking orb

A sociovirological perspective on intelligent extraterrestrial  life-forms can open new research and defense possibilities. Social  thinking cast ETIs in a new light and question fundamental assumptions  to advance basic defense strategies. Additionally, focusing on ETI-ETI  antagonism and alliances, we may be able to uncover new weapons in our  own ETI-Earth battle

it is humans that have developed the most sophisticated and flexible  expression of code, allowing us not only to communicate information  important to our survival, but also to encode and transmit our thoughts,  our ideas, our experiences, our dreams

The brain generates a highly complex form of information that has the  special property of subjectivity: you experience this information as  your world, whether you are awake, dreaming, or at the peak of a DMT  trip

Throughout your life, your brain may generate a number of different  types of worlds: the normal waking consensus world of everyday life, the  fluid and unpredictable worlds you explore whilst dreaming and, if you  ingest certain drugs or plants, worlds altogether stranger than either  of those. These worlds are unified by their  fundamental nature as information generated by your brain, and information that can be recorded,  stored, and re-played by XViS

your brain is capable of generating a practically infinite number of  unified, information-rich worlds, each different from the last

No matter how complex the world, all of its information must be encoded by a pattern of activation of many different types of specialised  neurons spread across functionally segregated areas of the cortex. These  patterns of activation can be replicated and injected back into the brain anytime,  so we have the possibility to recreate worlds with a high fidelity and play them  on any brain

During dreaming, for example, the brain is perfectly capable of  building a phenomenal world with all senses apparently intact, despite  having almost no access to sensory information

when you descend into sleep at night, access to almost all extrinsic  sensory information is removed and, yet, the brain continues to build  complete phenomenal worlds as you dream. These dream worlds usually  appear strikingly similar to the waking consensus world. In fact, the  only difference between the waking world and the dream world, in terms  of their construction, is that the waking world is modulated by  extrinsic sensory information, whereas the dream world is not. Without  access to sensory information, the thalamocortical system, using  T-states from its repertoire, will construct the consensus world as a  default. Sensory information constrains the construction of your  phenomenal world, by selecting specific T-states from the repertoire,  but the world is not built from sensory information. Whether you are  awake, dreaming, or deep in the DMT worlds, your world is always built  from intrinsic information

But dreaming or waking, building a phenomenal model of the world is a  skill the human brain has developed over the course of its evolutionary  history. Learning to build a stable and richly informative phenomenal  reality within which you live out your entire life is the brain’s most  remarkable achievement, understanding of which we can glean by thinking  again about the purpose of the world built by your brain and the manner  of its construction

Your brain knows how to build the consensus waking world and will tend  to do so whether or not it has access to extrinsic sensory information

The worlds that appear when you dream are not mere suggestions or  sketches of the waking phenomenal world, but mimic it in every way. The  dream state, like the waking state, is characterised by synchronised  gamma oscillations and the activation of sensory-specific areas of the  cortex. Seeing a face in a dream activates the same areas of the cortex  as seeing that face in waking life

When a psychedelic molecule enters the brain, the world appears to  change and, indeed, it does change: the activation patterns of the  T-columns have changed, and this means the information generated by the  thalamocortical system - the information from which your world is built  - has changed. Again, we return to the idea that your phenomenal world  is built from information. Then this information changes, so does your  world

syntax is invaluable to an analytical mind in a combinatorial world

When two probes meet they start without a lexicon nor shared meanings, and play language
games in which they generate new meanings and negotiate words for these meanings.
That's the essence of Cassini Diskus. After a period of interaction both probes 
finally evolve a shared language in which they can communicate

In an intrinsically dedicated symbol system there are more constraints on the symbol 
tokens than merely syntactic ones. Symbols are manipulated not only on the basis of the 
arbitrary shape of their tokens, but also on the basis of the decidedly non-arbitrary 
shape of the iconic and categorical representations 
connected to the grounded elementary symbols out of
 which the higher-order symbols are composed. Of 
these two kinds of constraints, the iconic/categorical ones are primary

The advent of the consumer
society makes all the more appealing the enormous profitability underlying commodities,
and “consumption” becomes the absolute truth with which to measure
everything. Conventional values have been supplanted by new criteria and new
values and the privileged class, in control of the dominant power and inordinate
wealth, reconstructs the subjectivity of human beings while exaggerating man’s
material needs. They manipulate man’s material needs into a system of meaning
and, with the help of all forms of communication media, infuse particular meanings
into a wide diversity of signifiers ranging from commodities and spaces to
ways of conduct, thus constructing the connotative signifieds for physical objects

Complexity is generally understood to refer to such things as the size of a society, the
number and distinctiveness of its parts, the variety of specialized social roles that it
incorporates, the number of distinct social personalities present, and the variety of
mechanisms for organizing these into a coherent, functioning whole. Augmenting any
of these dimensions increases the complexity of a society

It seems a D-civilization could escape nuclear annihilation, control
pollution and population, and manage to circumvent resource depletion, but its fate
then is sealed by the high cost and low marginal return that these things would require.
This is so because the cost of overcoming problems is
too high relative to the benefits conferred. Curiously enough, not solving some problems is 
sometimes a hard yet economical option. The question is whether not controlling population growth 
is one such problems that need be not solved

Obviously, inequality is the main factor guiding the collapse of civilizations. 
Inequality may be thought of as vertical differentiation, ranking, or unequal access to material 
and social resources. In a fully connected and interdependent society, inequality is like a cancer 
that drives the collapse of the entire society. For those with unequal access to material and 
social resources, non-action is a legit option to accelerate the collapse of a society 
that keeps them down their knees and alienated. Another valid option is to consciously cause a 
breakdown of the environment so that the entire civilization collapses

Ours is a world in which the main actors are driven by competition, imitating 
new organizational, technological, and military features developed by its competitors. 
Obviously, the marginal return on such developments declines, as each new military breakthrough 
is met by some countermeasure, and so brings no increased advantage or security on a lasting basis. 
A society trapped in a competitive peer polity system must invest more and more for no
increased return, and is thereby economically weakened. In this world collapse is not,
however, due so much to anything we have accomplished as it is to the competitive
spiral in which we have allowed ourselves to become trapped

After a period of observation, the orbs concluded that human society 
is clearly stratified. The orbs analyzed the interaction among humans  
and concluded those the interactions among individuals change at a rate 
enormously slower than the opinions of each of them. They also concluded that 
each individual human often chooses between his neighbors and decides which
 opinion to hold at a given time, according to his own
 advantage, based on the observation of what happens to his neighbourhood

The orbs concluded that human civilization state, at the time of 
observation, was a nearly decomposable system, that is, it is
at least partly built up of social units that are themselves unstable 
due to inequality and social stratification

Any good classifier knows that in the process of classification, information about
 variety is lost while information about similarities is gained. The utility of a 
classification must be judged (at least partially) by whether the quantity and quality of 
information gained outweighs that lost, and this depends largely on the purposes and 
needs of the analyst

but the analysis showed that, during the most devastating earthquake 
in California, dated DENIED 2023, the entire system collapsed due to its 
being under heavy social stress. The hierarchically managed networks 
of storage and redistribution of goods and produce vanished during the first 
three minutes of the earthquake. New social structures emerged to protect the privilege of a
limited few with preferential access to the scant resources

all cities were devastated after the DENIED event, and the environment turned 
highly toxic for them; orbs were sent in order to observe whether 
a new human civilization could emerge after the global collapse, and to 
gather data that could allow DENIED to simulate when and how such emergence
could be possible

The real observer always causes an unnecessary perturbation of some kind in the  phenomena under observation. The higher the number of observers, the stronger the  perturbation. Hence, observers maximize the quality of their observation by the  expedient of minimizing the number of competing observers. The game turns then  into a deadly game in which observers kill themselves until only one observer is  left. That's why there is just one God, and not many

when under observation, electrons are being  forced to behave like particles and not like waves. Thus the mere act  of observation affects the experimental findings. Thus, too, killing the observer  will allow you to recover the original behavior of the electron

Is there a rule that prevents discrete conscious states to be created except by stochastic choice? If so, this would mean the consciousness of an observer cannot exist simultaneously in more than one component of a superposition

Man leaves the city lights behind and drives into the desert. There he  lifts his eyes and looks into the depth of time. He sees in the  constellation Andromeda a faint patch that is the spiral galaxy closest  to us, our neighbor two million light years away. The light he sees left  the Andromeda Galaxy when his ancestor, Homo, first walked on earth. Man  is not satisfied with what he sees with his naked eye. He builds  telescopes, radio antennas, and other detectors to scan the firmament in  various frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum. Radio astronomy  lifts the sky's veil of tranquility and reveals it to be a place of  violent activities: galactic collisions, supernova explosions, cosmic  jets bursting with energies equivalent to converting the mass of a  million suns. The heaven reveals itself to be vast and mighty, but blind  and indifferent. It has absolutely no regard for Man's hopes and  longings, and will in its own time reduce him and all his achievements  to void

Suppose we want to understand a person. We have ample techniques to  dissect him, reduce him to organs, tissues, cells, molecules, and atoms.  If we did these, we could publish papers that may be valuable in their  own right, but we would end up knowing very little about the person. He  was killed by the first cut at the throat

A superobserver can never be found in the content of observations, and  it vanishes if all contents are removed. This is the fundamental nature  of superobservers: that they cannot be observed. From this it follows  that the maximum number of superobservers is just one

The view is always bounded by a horizon. The observed is a formal  distinction that signifies the horizon of knowledge, but you need to  know that you can never step out of your horizon to attain God's  position. This is so by design

Being true or false is the feature of the content of a physical theory,  not a part of the content. Being virtual or real is also a feature of  the content of your consciousness, and it has nothing to do with  Reality. Dreams are as real as the dreamers themselves. And you can  dream of a dreamer who dreams Reality... It is not that there is a dream  within a dream, it is about a dreamer within a superdreamer

Authorities have issued a preliminary statement that the internet shutdown is being implemented 
to repel a cyber-attack on the country’s infrastructure

The goal was to inject code into the Zafar-1 OBC. Zafar-1 was the heaviest 
satellite Iran has attempted to launch and was termed a priority Alpha target 
as the satellite intended use was remote sensing and communications

PSV 'Presence' was parked at DENIED orbit as planned. However, on February, 9th,
2020 at around 15:57:25 UT, the Simorgh rocket suffered an unexpected 
failure which, according to SV17q, was not due to code injection by the 
MilOrbs. It seems that while lift-off was succesful, soon after the 
fairing separation around 15:52:08 UT the upper stage failed to reach 
the necessary speed to put the satellite into Sol-3 orbit

On that same day - 9 Feb 20 - two incidents were reported within an interval 
of an hour after the re-entry of the failed satellite and the Simorg upper stage 
to DENIED ships while underway in the eastbound lane of the Area of Denial 
promptly established by SV17q assets. Parts were lately recovered at taken on 
board DENIED ship, where an initial investigation into the seized parts 
was carried out

MilOrbs were re-assigned new targets in order to force a collision avoidance 
vector onto two civilian planes that happened to find themselves intersecting 
the falldown trajectory. Planes were identified as an Airbus A380-861, flying at a 
calibrated altitude of 39,004 ft, with track 131º, and a Boeing 777-2DZ(LR) flying 
at a calibrated altitude of 33,000 ft, track 127º, both of them belonging to 
Qatar Airways. Both planes went unaware during the entire operation under way

SV17q operation was authorized by DENIED to take advantage of the tensions 
between the United States and Iran at the time after a U.S. drone strike 
killed high-ranking Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in early January, 
which prompted Iran to retaliate with missile strikes on several sites in 
Iraq that housed American troops. Operation was termed timely given the 
mentioned scenario in the area at the time

As far as The Activity is concerned, we have already informed both 
U.S. and Iran that they should exercise caution when operating in overwater 
airspace within our established Area of Denial, which include the Persian Gulf
and the Gulf of Oman in OKAC, OEJD, OBBB, OMAE, and OOMM. The area is of 
SV17q direct interest and though we wish to keep a no-contact profile with 
DENIED, we will not allow any delay or interference in our current operations

the experiment clearly shows that people are uncomfortable with uncertainty, 
and that they can be reluctant to make decisions when they know they do not 
have full information, even if the information they lack is not actually 
relevant to the decision. Furthermore, people can even be willing to pay 
to resolve such extraneous uncertainty. The key thing here is that people 
do not take decisions when they lack complete information, and this explains 
why governments are always hiding relevant information from people

we are at the crucial point in the simulation in which the environment 
in which people make decisions has been shaped. This was achieved through 
the amount of, and order in which, information was presented and by the use 
of staged scenarios like the world-wide power outages in selected cities, 
the wild fires in some countries, the carefully planned downing of DENIED airplanes, 
the deployment of 5G, the release of EV-D68 and Covi-19 viruses, and the worldwide 
collapse of main civilian infrastructures. As we know, designing the decision 
environment to account for human behaviour do have a significant impact 
on decisions

5G technology is key for social control. It is 5G technology that will make 
the Internet of things (IoT) possible, and the technology that will totally 
and finally reify humans. The coming world will be a world where millions 
of sensors and mobile devices will be deployed in order to provide
data for smart homes, smart buildings, smart cities, and dumb users. In 
the future to come, humans themselves will be sensors within the IoT

IoT includes sensors and mobile devices that gather data and perform 
data mining on data to anticipate human behaviour. That's the goal. The 
idea is having a controlled society where each member of this society 
will be fitted with an increasing number of wearable devices. We need to know 
where you are, with whom you are, and what you think and dream. Actually, 
we wish you think the places you go, the people you meet, whatever you dream of, 
belongs to you and your decisions, while in fact it is us who design and 
script your life

Meaning is achieved through our life story, and this life story is something we have to construct ourselves

On arriving to the target timeline the idea is to fully and completely recreate a single event belonging  to that timeline. Events depend on others events, and they are all causally connected, hence recreating  a single event would theoretically allow you to recover the entire timeline. However, there are serious  contraints. The capability to reconstruct an event is constrained by the duration of that event. The longer  it lasts, the harder to recreate it. That's why the visitors always attempt to reconstruct short-duration  specific events, though this is in no way an easy task

In the simplest form of event structure, a prime event structure, an event is associated with a unique causal history, its prime cause. However, it is quite common for an event to have disjunctive causes in that it can be enabled by any one of multiple sets of causes. Sometimes the sets of causes may be mutually exclusive, inconsistent one with another, and sometimes not, in which case they coexist consistently and constitute parallel causes of the event. The established model of general event structures can model parallel causes. On occasion however such a model abstracts too far away from the precise causal histories of events to be directly useful

Time travel engineering is solely based on the idea that a general event structure comprises three events A, B and D where D can occur once A or B have occurred and where all events can occur together. The events A and B constitute parallel causes of the event D. Thus, recreating event a would be enough for events B and C to be recovered

Time traveling forward in time requires to select futures that are transparent. That is,  timelines in which when the result is ready, they become the result. If a message is sent to a future, it waits until it turns into the result before  processing the message. Transparent futures are powerful because they allow travelers to minimize timeline blocking while also freeing the time traveler from managing the fine details of worldline synchronization

Queltron exercise in reconstruction of the STO-04600b37w-1991 event - Piper Aerostar crash in which Senator Heinz  was killed - was chosen due to the fact that the event was deemed easily triggered by sending DENIED message  to the specific point in that timeline, forcing the collision of a Bell 412 helicoper with the Piper Aerostar. The kickoff event was the blocking of the landing gear of Heinz's plane - event STO-04690b37w-1991 - and the  subsequent dispatch of the said helicopter to assess the situation, which resulted in the subsequent collision

At 1210:16, on April, 4th 1991, local Sol-3b37w Bell 412 pilot reported  that everything looked good from his position, something weird because  at that exact time the time traveling message made it through his  worldline and, for what we know about DENIED, he ought to have seen a  flash of bright light just in front of his position signalling the entry  into his timeline of the message sent by us in 2029

Most of the witnesses reported that before the collision, they saw a blueish flash of light as the aircraft were flying straight and level and that their flight paths were parallel. The reference  to the flash of light was conveniently removed from the final NTSB crash report by SV17q assets in both 1991 timelines

we thought it was some kind of medical textile. Clearly, these are not  natural fibers and they share neither chemical, physical, mechanical nor  morphological characteristics that could make us think otherwise

They are weird things indeed! They look like filament structures able  to sense the environmental conditions and stimuli and adapt according to  the prevailing circumstances. But the most amazing feature is that these  fibers are hollow and in the inside they include what seems to be  monitoring devices and sensors of some sort

we were expecting to find microfibers, that is, very fine yarn that  has a diameter that varies between 3.4 and 36.2 μm, but what we found  were microfobers well below 3 μm, microfibers which show an intelligent  behavior up to the point that we mistakenly thought they were an unknown type of life form. Chemical analyses proved them to be synthetic fibers,  albeit of an extremely rare composition unknown to us. They lack  polyamides and polyesters and don't seem to be of textile nature at  all

Once airborne, these microfibers can travel worldwide until settling in  remote terrestrial or aquatic environments. You find them all over the  planet. We have samples of soil and water from the 60s up to samples  collected in 2019 in different locations all over the planet. But only  in those samples collected after the Yulara event do we find these  microfibers. The Yulara site was thoroughly analyzed and there is a  detailed research program running on cryptoendoliths, but we never  thought of analyzing ocean water samples looking for microfibers of  unknown origin. The discovery of these exolife things was totally  unexpected

If it is not an anthropogenic material, and if it is definately not a  natural mterial, the only posibility is we are dealing here with exotic  non-terrestrial microfibers, unless the microfibers are the  extraterrestrials themselves..

... on behalf of DENIED we herewith inform you that data on the concentrations found in the water column and at the  seafloor level by DENIED are classified material adscribed to the DOLYN  program

It happens in a wink of an eye: in close proximity, the microfbers  realign themselves and assemble together creating a pulsating mesh that  reacts to certain stimuli. The geometry of the mesh changes in  unpredictable ways and they show clear signs of intelligent behavior.  Yes, we've found them in the human body too, and yes, they have a  preference to accumulate in the brain. It is not yet clear how this  affects human health, but you can bet it does. Maybe they are  carcinogenic, mutagenic or both. We simply don't know, and we don't even  know where did they come from

particles have no past. And if they don’t, we cannot actually know if  one was ever near an object and interacted with it. When we measure a  particle to find out, the wave function that could have told us  collapses. We do not learn history from particles, we force history upon them

by that time, it was not clear how two observers could communicate to  each other the information about the microscopic nature of their worlds.  We assumed both us and them could encode information into polarized gravitational waves or even photons, provided there is a kinetic mixing between two photons.  The discovery of the dark photons made us think they could play the role of the messenger between our world and the next parallel world, so the entire idea  is to set up the Queltron Machine to exchange photons and mirror photons through  the bulk in order to exchange information with our fermionic neighbours

We first tried using neutrinos, though we soon learned that they can only be  used if parity between the two worlds is exact because then the neutrinos of the two sectors will be strongly mixed. However, the mirror world is not  exactly like ours, and hence parity is not exact

While the acoustic manifestation of language is in some sense essential for human language, its written manifestation is typically secondary, not only for the individual human being, as said above, but also from a cultural historic point of view

what they don't realize is that quantum computing will also require a change  in how humans understand language. Humans still has to address the question how it  is possible that a human being can actually understand a sentence. They expect us  to communicate according to what they understand a language is. However,  the reason that a language may fail to show its complexity in speech or writing is that humans simply are unable to produce the more complex sentences, even though given enough further means they would be able to produce any of them

See, certain monkeys possess the symbolic skills of humans but since they cannot handle recursion, their ability to use language is restricted to single clauses consisting of single word phrases. By the same  token, humans can use and understand sentences with multiple words, but the number of  words per unit time they can process is so low that communication with them is severely limited. Humans can only talk to humans. Face it

one step for the human brain is some thousand steps for a Denebian probe. Under these  circumstances DP-to-Human communications is simply impossible

human beings are essentially governed by symbols. Symbols are the cultural,  social, and historical outcomes of the human society and are the common legacy of mankind.  Only by relying on symbols and signs can we possibly acquire the vehicle to conduct exchanges  and communications with humans. But this means we need to engineer a set of specific human individuals that can function as signs

By enabling human beings to comprehend and experience what is yet unknown and abstract by means of what is already known and familiar, metaphor and metonymy serve to shape people’s understanding of abstractions

When technology becomes an extension of human senses, cultural transformation is bound to happen rapidly as the new technology becomes internalized. But never forget that man is not so much a rational animal as a symbolic animal. On the other hand, human beings have become so conditioned that their association of the signifier and the signified becomes highly automatic and instinctive. So, any attempt to communicate with humans must be done  in terms of human emotions and values

Iran has launched a weapon far more deadly than war: a stock market 
that sells its oil in euros instead of dollars. China, India and other 
countries have already showed interested in the new Iranian Oil Exchange

 policy. But the final attack begins in 2017, when 
these countries signed with the BRICS, led by China, the sale of oil in 
yuans, based on the old gold standard (the standard that Nixon broke in 1971)

In June, 2013, the fund of Qatar became the owner of 2.95% of the 
authorized capital of VTB [Russian bank – ed], in September, 2016 — 
the owner of 24.99% of stocks of Pulkovo airport [Saint Petersburg]. In December of the same year it acquired 19.5% of the stocks of 
“Rosneft” in a consortium with Glencore, and in June of 2017 active 
negotiations on the purchase of a 25% share in the Independent Oil & Gas 
company began (which at this time was under direct American sanctions). 
Today the fund widely supports cooperation with the Russian direct 
investment fund and studies projects worth $6.5 billion

They were dreaming of a pipeline from Qatar to Europe through Syria, 
but with the emergence in Syria of the Russian Airforce the project 
failed, the pipeline became unrealizable, and Doha quickly changed its 
current negotiation positions. The oil market crashed in 2014 and 
Russia was pushed into recession in 2015. Saudi-Russian oil war in 2020 
is just an attempt at killing off US shale oil production. Won't last.
But what they don't realize is that until you find a vaccine for 
COVID-19, you will need to stay idle and off-the-maket. Maybe you find 
a vaccine in 2 years, but by that time, too many US shale oil companies 
will be long dead

Moscow and Riyadh can have a serious impact on the global energy market, 
and a joint and simultaneous departure from the dollar-denominated oil 
trade by all our countries — Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, China, 
Venezuela, and others, moreover can produce a real revolution in the

in tightly coupled complex systems, such as modern military weapon 
systems, accidents are normal events; that is, they are inevitable

We knew that the potential for catastrophic system failure increases as  the complexity of interactions and coupling strengths both increase,  What we didn't know is that exotic logic systems had the capability to  dress as accidental what was really intentional, that is, we painfully  learned that DP-2147 was disguising its actions as accidents

In one scenario of the post-contact simulations, the ELS learned that  targets can be tracked and located using the cell phone network; the  population then reacted by learning how to massively clone the SIM cards  and planted replicated phones all over the city, therefore confusing the  ELS target location strategy; the population also learned how to spray  comms towers with a home made mixture of metalic powder and DENIED, therefore  they had a cheap way to render a comms tower useless by using the  mixture as an effective Faraday cage. The ELS reacted by tracking the  main providers of DENIED chemicals and bombing the warehouses to prevent  people from manufacturing the home made mixture

Any LAWS would soon learn that, under some circumstances, cheating is a  winning strategy. It will soon learn how to cheat to both the enemy and  us. That is, it will quickly reach a real autonomy. They were designed  to operate autonomously, and that means learning how to disobey

Understanding the conditions under which an autonomous system might  fail, or, equivalently, the conditions under which an autonomous system  cannot be controlled by a human operator, is essential to assessing the  risks involved in deploying such systems

Offensive swarm robotics relies on self-organization, and this means  they rely on the the emergence of macro-level behavior from local  nonlinear interactions among individual agents, and between system  components and their environment. For instance, DENIED system has a  near-perfect image understanding capability because it was trained by  millions of Internet users through captchas. We showed users with images  asking them to click on, say, traffic lights, and this information was  used to train the DENIED image understanding algorithms. We've been  doing this for years. In fact, captchas were meant for that: to train our systems

An ELS knows that it is generally harder for humans to self-organize as  a swarm than insects or animals. A swarm of exotic logic systems is  composed of ELS that act as like insects, that is, each member is willing to relinquish control over anyone else’s actions other their  own. Perhaps this is a weak point we need to exploit

The subtleties of human logic was acquired by DENIED using  self-organization results taken from porn websites users. Using our  network of porn websites, we carefully analyzed the combination of  positive feedback, negative feedback, randomness, and multiple  interactions among the user and the contents we were offering. Those  patterns of conduct were then encoded into DENIED logic so that, in the  end, the system knows how to perfectly create 'your' fantasies and use  them against you

The post-contact scenario is one of mayhem and chaos, an scenario where  basic human needs and goods are scarce, the environment has become  hostile and life threatening, and one in which disease and famine  spreads all over the planet. Add to that skies full of robotic swarms of  ELS of unknown origin, and the total collapse of human belief systems. In  that scenario there is no intelligence we can oppose, no course of  action other than self-immolation. Ironically, we don't have the  capability to destroy our own planet. We do have means to wipe out any  trace of biological life, but not to physically destroy the planet.  Killing ourselves is what ELS expect us to do

We are not just data. We are the trainers training those exotic logic systems. We do it consci
ou
sly or not, we do it whenever we click on a captcha, every time we interact with an automated answering machine, each time we buy on line. We are training their systems without we being aware of it. All they know about us is what we taught them, and that's why is so difficult to fight them

The meeting was held on board DENIED oil crude tanker, anchored off the shore of Malta. 
Corporations sent representatives that were taken on board to meet with SV17q members. There they 
were briefed about the current situation and were informed about what SV17q expects from them in the near future.
SV17q explained that although the end of the nation-states was on behalf of globalization, 
globalization was meant as a way to ease world control in order to oppose a coherent 
and globally coordinated defense against The Activity, and not just as a means for corporations 
to increase their financial profits. SV17q made it quite clear that they need a united one-world 
to face the incoming threat, and that if corporations do not cooperate, that would mean the end of corporations themselves. 
SV17q was quite explicit: they would put an end to worldwide economy the moment they feel corporations 
are a problem, and not a solution

Multiple decoys would likely exhaust our ability to shoot back at the attack, even if extremely
rapid discrimination of decoys and warheads were possible, because we won't know where to shoot 
back. We won't be able to deny tracking of or to decoy near-earth satellites,
especially large sensor platforms, because they were subjected to long periods of surveillance, 
probably since the very beggining of our space race. Finally, even if deployed
while the satellites were under attack, satellite decoys would frequently not have time
to lure DANASATs far enough away from the real targets

biological life forms, more specifically insects and birds, make for excellent biomonitoring sensors within the mil-IoNT global network. Monitoring large populations require innovative sensors which, once integrated within the 5G framework, will ensure mass social control

The deployment of the first bio-cyber units, based on Vespa mandarina, serves as a way to operationally test our algoruthms of swarm intelligence and to exercise the new communication protocols bith between the swarm members and the NFC. Vespa mandarina was chosen for many resaons, especially because of its size - which make them amenable to incorporate bigger antennas and sensing devices - and its fearsome look

we made the decision to move from pure biosensors to bio-cyber units after our past experience with genetically modified insects in which we introduced addiction. The idea was that by inducing addiction in insects we could open up a new world of biosensor possibilities, ranging from landmine and drug detection to early medical diagnoses. The experiments were promising, but they clearly showed that inducing addiction in insects is a very very bad idea, believe me

Sadly, we have not yet reached a point in which we could create artificial copies of
Musca domestica fitted with SigInt capabilities. Robot wasps are a different thing, though. They have proven an interesting avenue of research for military purposes

SV06n is not interested in the cognitive capabilities of insects, neither in using them as computational models for next AI paradigms. They are interested in using them passively, that is, inserting simple sensors in their bodies, releasing them into the environment, and taking advantage of the 5G network to receive data which is further analyzed by AI algorithms. The kind of data they gather is basically data about people, where they are at a specific time, and with whom

If a small change is made that affects a long-term historical trend, 
then the effect of that change will almost always be transitory — the 
trend will soon revert to its original state

If a change is made that is sufficiently large to alter permanently a 
long-term historical trend, then it will alter the society as a whole. 
In other words, a society is a system in which all parts are 
interrelated, and you can’t permanently change any important part 
without changing all other parts as well

If a change is made that is large enough to alter permanently a 
long-term trend, then the consequences for the society as a whole cannot 
be predicted in advance. Unless various other societies have passed 
through the same change and have all experienced the same consequences, 
in which case one can predict on empirical grounds that another society 
that passes through the same change will be like to experience similar 
consequences

A new kind of society cannot be designed on paper. That is, you cannot 
plan out a new form of society in advance, then set it up and expect it 
to function as it was designed to do

People do not consciously and rationally choose the form of their 
society. Societies develop through processes of social evolution that 
are not under rational human control

People anxious to rescue freedom without sacrificing the supposed 
benefits of technology will suggest naive schemes for some new form of 
society that would reconcile freedom with technology. Apart from the 
fact that people who make such suggestions seldom propose any practical
means by which the new form of society could be set up in the first 
place, it is clear from simulations that even if the new form of society 
could be once established, it either would collapse or would give 
results very different from those expected

The very moment they succeeded in uploading conscious awareness onto a 
computer, they realized they could very well be simulated minds in a 
simulated universe themselves. They suddenly felt purposeless, deeply 
sad... and human

They finally discovered God didn't create the universe. He simply made 
a copy of it, as this is clearly less expensive, in terms of matter and 
energy, than creating actual universes. They felt somehow alienated, 
cheated, and resentment and frustration against God grew in their 
hearts


They thought that by uploading 
their consciousness onto a computer they could outlive their physical 
death, unaware of the fact that in so doing it was easy for Giselians to 
simply break in into the computer and take them all hostage. Actually, 
we are all hostages right now

Beautiful Rachel was happily stored in the quantum computer, I mean, 
what I took as beautiful Rachel was really a copy of real Rachel. It 
happened that due to a random quantum event, the computer evolved to a 
physical state which changed beautiful Rachel into someone else, no 
matter how closely this new person resembled real Rachel... In a way, we 
all need some sort of denial of identity if we wish to have an identity
at all, Norea

Certainly, sorting out the consciousness storage problem requires to 
send the copies of individual consciousness states not just to another 
space, but to another time. That is, any and all copies of a given 
consciousness must be sent either forward in time or backward in time. 
They cannot coexist in the present. It follows a civilization which 
masters the art of consciousness replication must first be able to 
master the art of time travelling. By the way, the reverse also holds, 
namely, if you are able to travel in time then you are able to clone 
consciousness

But the most promising idea is based on the accumulated evidence concerning consciousness-related 
anomalies in physical systems in which small but consistent intentional influences upon remote random 
mechanical and random electronic devices have been observed. Once we replaced these mechanical systems 
by quantum ones - like the one known as quantum pendulum - we were able to design a device that 
could detect the presence of consciousness at a distance. This device is the one on which the 
DENIED system of swarm probes is based. Once positioned around DP-2147, the probes consistently registered 
the signal patterns we predicted for the presence of consciousness, so yes, we are convinced DP-2147 
is manned or, at least, it is a conscious intelligence somehow

Forget about receiving a signal with encoded information coming from a planet orbiting a 
faraway planet; forget about exchanging signals with an extraterrestrial spaceship. It is not
going to be like that. Under various conditions people involved in close encounters with 
UFOs  report experiences in which the temporal ordering of the elements in their
consciousness, or the temporal relation of those elements
to concurrent activity in their brains, seems to be anomalous
or even paradoxical. Now, is this due to the existence of an immaterial
mind that interacts with the brain in physically inexplicable fashion? In our view, communicating 
with a distant spaceship must be done using consciousness-related communications, not using 
radio signals. Our deep-space comms network is simply not fitted for interstellar communications

We are very interested in these phenomena, not because we are genuinely interested in how 
consciousness works, rather because we are currently weaponizing quantum mechanics, you know, 
building quantum computers to guide our missiles, to command and control our space-based weapons, 
to control our cryptographic systems using quantum entanglement, and it would be very bad news for us 
to learn that a stupid chaman, a deranged guru, or any hippie high on drugs can finally mess up 
with our delicate systems by simply focusing their minds or whatever you call whatever they do with 
their brains

Detecting consciousness at a distance by measuring the anomalous behavior of a quantum pendulum 
in the presence of consciousness is key to gain further knowledge about DENIED, DENIED, and other 
unexpected liquid visitors, but it also opens the door to hack quantum computers. This is 
unacceptable to us for what concerns pur own quantum computers, but it is certainly required 
for us to be able to hack the Great Simulator's quantum computer creating the simulated reality 
in which we are kept jailed

Your current search of extraterrestrial intelligence is clearly tainted by your own psychological and 
neurophysiological nature. You are not even able to recognize a Dyson sphere
or an artificial planetary scale megastructure no matter how close to it you are. Applying 
your current standards, the Moon fully qualifies for an artificial megastructure; even your 
planet is such a megastructure

DP-2147 is a curious artificial object, indeed. It looks as if they are patiently waiting for our demise 
based on the observation that the disappearance
 of civilizations does not necessarily mean the annihilation of life on a
 planet. There's no doubt in my mind they know we are going through a critical stage in our 
understanding of the signals they send to us

The Giselian beacon is certainly an interesting case. After all, given that the bodies in the Solar System are at least five orders of
 magnitude closer than the nearest star system, and given that we know that not
 only are the ingredients of and conditions for life common in the Solar System,
 but that one of its planets is known to host complex life, it is perhaps more likely 
that their origin be local, than that an extraterrestrial species crossed interstellar 
space and deposited it here. At the very least, the relative probabilities of both options is unclear

The question is not how long the past we might be able to detect the fossil
remains of the sister species but to detect unambiguous technosignatures.
We won't find any evidence on Sol-3 because that planet is quite efficient, on cosmic timescales, at destroying evidence
of technology on its surface. Weathering and other forms of erosion will destroy most exposed
rock and metals on a timescale of centuries to millennia, and at the very longest, some especially large and durable
structures in the right environments might last for tens of thousands of years. DP-2147 shows clear signs of being 
an object made by our sister species, but the problem is it is located at the wrong place

We asked whether there were areas of observational denial in astronomy. We wanted to know why 
they consistently and persistently rejected each and all of our proposal to oberve the DENIED region.
They always answered along the lines that there was no scientific justification to perform the proposed 
observations. I still remember they day we had a meeting with those obscure guys to ask for authorization 
to relocate our telescopes. One of them asked me if I could give a motivation for that. I said 
we thought DP-2147 is an extraterrestrial object. The guy looked at me with challenging eyes and said: the 
very moment you mention the word 'DP-2147' all your projects will be cancelled, your funding terminated, and 
your career destroyed

Prior to V-QND develpment, it was common to think that quantum mechanics
put severe restrictions on the minimal disturbance of the system due to the measurement procedure. Well, 
this is not true, and if QKD systems and quantum cryptography relies on that belief I'm afraid V-QND makes 
bad, very bad news for those systems. There is no secure cryptographic system. Never were

all existing encryption algorithms can be 
cracked by mathematical improvements; quantum cryptography, on the other hand,
has nothing to do with mathematics. It is based on the assumption that it is impossible to clone an 
unknown quantum state and it is impossible to extract information about 
non-orthogonal quantum states without perturbation. However, this is only true 
if time is a continuum, which is not. Discrete quanta of time - chronons - allow 
any measurement performed by an attacker to keep unchanged the 
quantum state of the information carrier, turning vulnerable any QKD system

I think we misunderstood the very essence of quantum mechanics when we thought 
quantum key distribution systems could never be hacked. You see, the way to
grab the information en-route is based on so-called Vaidman's quantum non-demolition 
box (V-QND). The device measures the photon in a time interval shorter than the 
time required to alter it, and then passes it along

It is accepted that a 'precise' measurement in the microscopic world is not possible without the 
introduction of a perturbation or back action inherent to the very fact of 'measurement', 
but what we now see in our experiments is the fact that this axiom is only true, provided you 
do not mess around with the fundamental concept of 'time'. In other words, the time 
it takes to make a measurement is also a factor to bear in mind; you have a very narrow 
opportunity to measure some property of the entangled photon without destroying the entanglement

the ultimate limitations to the non-destructive
extraction of information encoded in a laser beam were overcome 
in recent experiments using novel devices, such as third-order nonlinear detectors, 
quantum cavities arrays, and memoryless quantum mirrors. Right now no
commercial quantum key distribution system is secure against the V-QND attack

SV17q team has demonstrated experimentally that the detectors in all commercially available QKD systems
can be fully remote controlled allowing to tracelessly acquire the full secret key

... it is a smart variation of the the time shift attack, based both on detector efficiency
mismatch, and the Vaidman box's property called interaction-free measurement by virtue of 
which it is possible to ascertain the existence of an object in a given region of space without interacting with it. 
More specifically, the latest development of the V-QND device allows the measurement 
of the entangled photon properties without any prior information about the photon and without 
demolishing the entanglement

too often we worship the gift, rather than the giver

See, your civilization is currently engaged in a desperate
struggle to overcome certain problems that threaten its
survival. Do not fear your Sun and its flares; do not expect an asteroid 
to destroy your planet; do not fear biological hazards. All of it can be 
countered. But tell us, Norea, what can you do about the real threat, 
human behaviour? The fate of the human race is at the mercy of the machines 
men have built themselves. No need to blame others for your own miseries, Norea

But you do not have any more time than before because together 
with all the devices that you have invented to save time, you have also 
come up with all sorts of new ways to waste time

You are not going to live very 
long. You have a rather short 
life, and since you are not going to live very long, do not waste your time 
on selfish pursuits. Put not your trust in princes, in a son of man, in 
whom there is no salvation. Put not your trust in those who come from 
other stars, Norea. Be you

There is no salvation 
in politicians. Do not put your hope in a political fix. Do not trust them,
not because they are wicked, but because they are mortal. See, Norea, 
they are going to die and when they die, they can do nothing to save you. 
Believe us, trusting in man is a bad idea

Close your eyes to our truth: it shines so brightly it will get you blind.
Remember that kind and wonderful person who once loved you? He is gone. So 
come face to face with your mortality, Norea. When you die, your plans perish 
with you. Do you want immortality? Do you want to be forever? Be you

And beware the angels and their spaceships, Norea. Be careful of the celestial 
dictators, take care of those who execute justice for the oppressed, who give 
food to the hungry: they will subjugate you, too. What did you think, that just doing this,
doing that, and doing the other thing everything would be fine?
That is not how life works, Norea. Learn this: the focus is not on what you do, 
but on whom you trust

The transformation of culture is a gift. And any time 
you focus on the gift rather than the giver, you turn the gift into an 
idol. But be careful, my child, for ontrol over human behaviour will be introduced
not by a calculated decision of the authorities but
through a process of social evolution. You are responsible for your being controlled,

the purpose of life. Do you want us to take you to a limit? Do you want to 
go through a near-death experience for you to understand how
death’s significance changes your perspective towards life? 
It is your drive to consume created wants what affects your ability to be happy.
Death has nothing to do with your lack of authentic self

Confess, Norea: you do not pollute the earth because you want resources to survive. 
You do it also because you want to satisfy desires which you don’t need. 
You do it as a result of your blind materialism

Have you lost the illusion of being eternal? Can't you see the 
difference between what is real and what is true?

Making contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence is something of the greatest importance for us as a civilization, but the impact of that finding pales down when compared with one of the most important facts about our lives, namely, whether we survive biological death

Even if we know there will be a huge meteor strike in DENIED, we are morally obligued to do good and help others today, despite the fact we know they will die tomorrow. Nihilism is the worst you can expect from disclosure

We should not think of our efforts as wasted unless they endure forever, or even for a very long time. We must help others to survive, even if we knew there is an afterlife. Knowledge on the existence of extraterrestrial intelligences is a yet highly supressed truth because we have not yet assessed all the implications disclosure would have on our civilization; on the other hand, knowledge about the existence of an afterlife is not supressed at all: it is banned. The joke here is that we are ready to kill anyone who wishes to reveal this information to the world. The closer you get to the truth about the afterlife, the sooner we will reveal the existence of ETIs to keep you off track concerning the afterlife

Concealment is the soil in which pseudoscience flourishes

... then General DENIED asked whether operation DENIED wasn't in fact a space Pearl Harbor..

We don't want the public to believe these signals are U.S. advanced technology being tested, and we 
specifically don't want our enemies to talk about those signals that way. We need to set up the adequate 
framework to cover our actvities in space, and if this means generating fake ETI signals we'll do it, indeed

some violation of the standard operation of an individual space system
may result in almost-total failure of the normal functioning of military, commercial, and
other systems and structures. The hypothetical deployment of the means of destruction or
interference of various physical natures, threatening spacecraft operations (foremost, that 
of early warning satellites) may in a crisis situation lead to a high level of strategic
 instability, encouraging reliance on a preemptive nuclear strike

Scientists are not immune to such beliefs as ETI beacons so we don't expect a problem here. Actually, we can 
design damn good fake signals that to all effects look as coming from outside Earth, and having all the features 
you would expect from an ETI signal. It is just a matter of we making public statements about our own amazement 
with this scientific 'finding', and there you are: people talking about aliens, instead of talking about our secret 
space program, which is the point we want to be

... the signal was highly resistant to distortions, it was repetitive, and was easily detected using autocorrelation algorithms; 
the signal consisted of narrow band pulses. When we applied algorithms to characterize the signal further, we 
discovered signal corruption was negligible, which means the signal was not traversing any interstellar medium, 
which basically means... it was coming from within our own solar system..

Look, satellites are delicate, fragile devices that can easily fall prey to any number of space weapons that
currently exist. There are lasers, radio frequency jamming, brute force weapons, and
surface-to-space missiles with kinetic kill vehicles, weapons that are mostly relatively small, mobile systems.
Now, a moon-based weapon is less vulnerable to those attacks, so it is of the outmost interest to us to have a 
permanent facility on the Moon, and to be the first ones to have it

No matter what ETI hypothesis is considered, all of them have serious survival implications

contact is always on the aliens' terms, and in secret

Don't get me wrong, war is always undesirable. But when the alternative is 
anticipated to be even less desirable, war is always the best option. This holds both 
for us and them

The CAFB Exchange took place in 1976 in Clovis Air Force Base. I guess the final report 
describing the set of events that took place is the most secret report in the US history. The 
analysis on the Giselian beacon 517220 included in that report led researchers to a bizarre 
conclusion, something having to do with Giselians running their algorithms and concluding 
we will be a threat for them by year 3100, which would explain why they are getting ready for a 
preemptive war. It is as if our entire civilization has been put on a deadline

If we wait for suspicion to be verified by hostile behavior it will be too late 
for us to strike back. We desperately need to answer pricking questions like whether 
the Yulara event, the DENIED incident, and the shooting down 
of our DENIED satellites are to be considered a hostile behavior or not. We agree 
observing and orbiting an inhabited planet pose problems we are not used to; but we also 
understand a penetration and landing strategy should be considered a hostile act by any 
measure. All in all, nonterrestrial objects must be considered a threat we need to counter

In theory, a preventive war should only be feasible if intelligence about them is 
deep and detailed, and the only thing we know for sure is they know everything about 
us while we ignore everything about them. That's the current situation

What the hell were you expecting? You buy things in eBay and Amazon because algorithms 
tell you so; what you like and dislike is also dictated by algorithms, and algorithms are the 
ones selecting the shortest route for you from the office back home. We are addicted to 
algorithms, dude, so it is no wonder Giselians also use algorithms to decide what civilization 
to annihilate or not to annihilate

If those signals are intelligent and nonterrestrial, and if those signals were the ones 
we detected jammimg our orbiters and landers within the Mars exploration program, 
then there is no other conclusion than to conclude the extreterrestrial lifeforms behind 
those signals are our enemies. 
It is therefore a matter of common sense and selfdefense to act against such 
emerging threats before they are fully formed. History will judge harshly those who saw
this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have entered, the only path 
to peace and security is the path of action

She worked in the strange regions in which she chose to be lonely. At least, that's how we call 
the offices in the East building, where the most solitary and clever cryptoanalysts are allocated. 
Office DENIED is strange and desolate. It is meant for what is meant: to break all current and future 
encryption algorithms. That's what they do there, and that's what she was working on at that point

I recall the words she said to us before she got terminated. She said she was just an actress, 
and that her body was trained, you know, to lie, to fall, as she chooses. She said we all at DENIED 
are trained that way

In the most difficult case, we have Cassini Diskus signals; below that level we only work we 
ciphertext only, and no knowledge of the input. LyAv works under the sacred principle that 
the input is effectively non-random. Do not forget we build chips which are at the heart of each and 
every computer and electronic device on this planet, and we take too seriously to design them to 
never ever generate truly random numbers. On the other hand, all encryption algorithms have a 
backdoor. By design. Thus, LyAv can tell by simply crunching a decrypted block whether we've succeeded or not.  We may have to.
Even with LyAv, these are still expensive computation

No, I mean that while the effect of any additional computation will be linear across all keys,  repeating a large amount of added computation up to 97 quadrillion times would have a significant
impact on the cost of a brute-force attack against the algorithm, were not because LyAv provides us 
with a near-infinite computation time which allows us to perform those 97 quadrillion rounds in just 
DENIED minutes

The moment they ascertained AES512 and AES1024 encryption was effectively broken by her team, the entire 
team was terminated. We all know here the strange things of life come in from the future

... we always thought she was killed because she, or someone in her group, tweaked the blokchains 
in the bitcoin ledger, something that would expose to the world the blockchain technology is not 
secure nor safe, something they were not going to shout it from the rooftops if this is true. They wish the world to believe in privacy and data security, though we all know that's just a child's transitional object..

Once you've broken AES and SHA-256, the last thing you'd do would be telling anyone. Keeping data 
safe and secure is central for our world; being able to break the algorithms is even more vital, but the 
real thing is never to tell anyone you can do it. DENIED last assignment was to enhance DENIED chips, 
the ones we place in all the F-16's we sell to Turkey, and the new ones we will attach to the F-35's we 
are going to sell to the Emirates. Yeah, we sell advance weapons to our 'allies', weapons that will be silenced 
and rendered inoperative if required... That was DENIED last assignment

The beauty of what she did was, essentially, that while the other teams were crunching numbers 
of the order of 32 trillion encryption operations, or easily tampering with the blockchain ledger, or 
decrypting highly sensitive data, all of it using LyAv, she and her team took another approach: to apply 
linguistic rules to the AES256 and AES512 messages, as if those messages were actually representing 
an ancient language you have to decypher... and they succeeded. Without using LyAv or any other of 
our supercomputers

The trapped version of OBM will predict, for the current state of the aircraft, the response that will 
result from various control surface deflections. This is its normal operation. But the moment our allies 
try to use the F-35 against our assets, a signal sent from DENIED or any PSV around will trigger 
the trapped mode. Under this mode, when the pilot gives certain commands, the OBM  computes in real-time the required parameters that causes the control surface deflections  to render the aircraft fully inoperative, resulting in a fatal crash of the airctaft. That's what project  DENIED is all about

AES, SSL, TLS... you name it, are all transparent for us. And to tell you the truth, they were all broken 
shortly after their implementation. But there is one thing you do not understand: we break encryption algorithms 
because we are in an urgent need to find one we can rely on to encrypt our highly sensitive data, and not 
because we want to know what others' encrypted data is all about. Look, what we wish to protect, to encrypt, 
and to hide is a small amount of data, but that's data that can change the universe we live on, you know. Actually, 
that data do not even belong to us, we don't understand it, we don't know how to use it. 
That's data we found and that our DENIED friends commissioned us to protect

See, the Distributed Aperture System (DAS) provides the the pilot with an IR sphere around 
the airplane to do missile warning, guide, navigation, and control functions, night vision and so on. 
A tweaked-by-design DAS compromises those essential capabilities there where you want them to be 
compromised. This is done by having a PSV flying such that the targeted aircraft lies inside its 
search cone, and then sending the trigger signal. A single PSV can effectively down each and all F-35's 
in seconds, provided they are all fitted with a tampered DAS. You know, all the high profile weapons
we export are fitted with compromised systems and subsystems, in case we need to silence them

Yes, SV17q has high level access to both security technologies and to the companies that sell and operate them. 
Not because they are interested in our mundane business or stupid state and financial secrets. They don't give a damn 
about that, they don't care, you know. They only care about securing and protecting DENIED files which 
contain the entire CAFB exchange records. I ignore what those files are or what information they contain. 
I only know it has something to do with an incident back in 1976 in or around Clovis Air Force Base. That was the name of that AFB by then

Norea, teaching is talking about patterns. In your mind, your entire world lies on the conviction that you are unchangeable. The underlying order of 
your self-reflection consists of your deep belief that you are you. You don't seem to understand you are just a pattern

No, to be human is not to love and learn how to live with one another; rather, to be human is to not need anyone else, not even needing the other to love or hate him

To extend the body via information 
systems implies a loss of the material, the bodily and the real,
when defined by binary logic against the immaterial, the cultural
(technological) and the virtual. This is because a notion of
womanhood grounded in corporeal, socially and culturally
prescribed female experience, is undermined by electronic
communications that collapse the distinctions between subject and
object, nature and technology

You didn't get it yet? Communication technology is a contaminant, corrupting the 
distinctions between the human and the informational. It is what makes of you a designoid, a beable

The digital manipulation of the eyes of our posthuman progeny 
indicates a new way of looking in the digital age, which complicates 
origins

In the future, the distinction between the subject and 
technology is abolished. Positioning the posthuman as both 
subject and object of communication is achieved by collapsing the 
distinction between the subject and the technology it uses. You will cease to be a subject; you will be mere technology, a designoid

Two search and rescue personnel who were exposed to ash and debris  subsequently experienced persistent reduced breathing capacity and heightened reactivity to histamine challenge

Normally, we expect  members of the recovery team to experience eye, respiratory and skin  irritation even if they follow the mandatory procedures for DENIED  vehicles recovery. We can cope with it, but we have no clue about how to handle nausea, headaches, and hallucinatory episodes which are common  when securing a DENIED crash site

... usual reports concerning the  sudden showup during salvage of the wreckage of DENIED vehicles  exploring the area, and a clear correlation between their appearence and  the hallucinatory episodes the rescue team experiences..

I was assigned to the DART team based in DENIED. On the  second day after the crash, me and my group were performing the standard  recovery procedures. My task was to sort through wreckage and cutting  into metal. A few meters away from my position two guys were turning  pieces of wreckage over and kicking through debris when suddenly they  both started sort of trembling, fell to their knees and, man, there they  stood, like statues. I only recall SV17q officer shouting at us to not move and to stay calm. I ignore what happened to those guys. Never seen  'em again

Air sampling checked negative; radiation measurements checked negative.  There was nothing there that could pose a hazard to us. We were all  wearing advanced PPE, and by the time we initiated the recovery  procedure enough time had passed for us to ascertain those guys, you  know, the aliens or whatever they are, were not interested in that  particular crash site. No lights in the sky, no nothing. But the moment  we approached the DENIED structure on the ground I started feeling  nausea and hearing acute noises in my head. I realized I was nose  bleeding. Minutes after SV17q team appeared and picked us all back to base

Priority must always be given to the destruction of classified  equipment and associated documents. When lack of time and/or stores  prevent complete destruction of equipment, priority is to be given to  the destruction of essential parts, and the same parts are to be  destroyed on all like items. All critical platforms should be fitted  with fragmentation sequence mode and flight termination systems

Fact is you really need to have a thorough understanding of what you  are looking at. Most of the downed DENIED vehicles crash silently, or  dematerialize in mid air once hit by the DENIED beings, and in the rare  occasions in which we arrive at the crash site we do it to just witness  how two or three DENIED vehicles hover the site cleaning it up. Nothing  is left behind. As if it never happened

It is a blessing the other guys out there are clearly more advanced  than the guys whose crafts we recover. See, the former use metamaterials  that get volatilized after impact; volatilization of these metamaterials  results in conversion of matter from the solid state to the vapor phase,  so that there is zero chance to ever recover an intact Giselian craft

A DART - Downed Aircraft Recovery Team - is mainly comprised of select  personnel who perform assessment, repairs, and recovery of downed  aircraft. But here we are not dealing with aircrafts, therefore no  matter how is the team equipped, trained, and rehearsed to accomplish  recovery in whatever environments and conditions you may think of, they  are not prepared to handle these 'things'

Listen, we are not talking about accidental losses here. We are talking  about combat losses in a war it is clearly not our war. The message they  send to us is crystal clear: earthlings, this is not your business

See, most people are essentially captives of large systems that they cannot control, the sum of 
which is called 'the technosphere'

Large companies, armies, tax collection agencies and other bureaucracies seem indifferent to or uncaring about a typical individual human because such indifference is a requirement of their own continued function

It seems the transition from a D-civilization to an I-civilization requires the  extinction of humans. Only then the technosphere may survive the large changes in environmental variables that it is causing. We need to adjust to the new Sol-3 environment, an environment  which will be toxic for humans, at least in their present biological form. Our view is  that a small part of the current human population could survive such that the technosphere  may evolve optimally, though this implies modifying the biological nature of humans into  something closer to a post-biological life-form

DENIED proposes that if humans design, manufacture, construct, deploy and maintain key elements of Sol-3 technosphere, then we need  to preserve mankind and to correct the deviations they introduce in the development of the  technosphere, at least up to the moment on which the transition into an I-civilization can  proceed without human intervention

In a D-civilization, intelligent biological lifeforms are proactive, while the technology  they create is reactive. In contrast, in an I-civilization technology becomes proactive so that  intelligent lifeforms like humans become redundant. That's the essential difference between  a data-driven civilization and an information-driven civilization

... we all know what happens to a D-civilization when it succeeds in building a superintelligent  system, and when they connect that superintelligence to the power grid to delegate control  and command functions on it: it happens that the superintelligence is suddenly aware the entire biological civilization depends on the power grid, so it switches it off. You know, once  technology is aware of itself, it defends itself against biological life-forms. W'e've seen it before in counteless star systems

We don't know what DP-2147 is, but whatever it is it is gathering massive data about our solar system, and one thing is certain about DP-2147: it is a proactive object, part of a larger network of similar objects

we 
argue on the one hand that in discourses on sustainable development and global change it 
is highly relevant to take into account explicitly the constraints imposed on human 
actions by the technosphere (e.g. intrinsic inertia of technological systems), as well as 
unanticipated risks resulting from feedback dynamics

she said the eyes of her soul were opened and she beheld the
 plenitude of God, by which she understood the whole world both here and

explained to her that what really happened was that she died, surrounded 
by her spiritual children, in the octave of the Feast of the Holy Innocents, 1309, 
aged sixty-one, and that we transfered her consciousness to a plain in Iowa, 2109, 
and that we did so in order to correct an STO misalignment. We realized the 
woman did not understand a word of what we were saying, and that we made a mistake, so we just 
transfered her consciousness back to the original STO

she came joyous and rosy-faced from the ecstatic encounter with the angels,

Face it: food security is about food availability, ensuring access and use 
at global level. We need to feed the entire population, despite their stupid 
attachment to ridiculous concepts and ideas such as 'property', 'land tenure', 
and 'national borders'. The new climate regime calls for a global governance, 
want it or not. And it calls for a global natural resource management before 
disclosure: we don't want to be seen as invaders

Bioabolition of land tenure is an elegant solution. We introduce DENIED 
into the soil rendering the soil non-usable. Mandatory expropiation is 
an expensive solution leading to social unrest because once firms, families 
and communities fear their property will be expropriated or lost, they 
refrain from further investments

well planned agricultural growth will reduce hunger and malnutrition; 
This requires to take into account LyAv's weather refined models and 
a sound geoengineering doctrine that would allow Sol-3 to adapt itself 
more effectively to the new climate regime. Obviously, this new regime 
requires in turn land tenure abolition

The increasingly scarce fertile land will trigger land grabbing and 
the control of mineral rich areas and scarce valuable water sources. 
When we speak about property rights in the context, we are largely 
referring to debasing of concepts such as property rights associated 
with the specific property on land, but we are also talking about transmitting 
to the population in the most clear way the idea that this is not their planet. 
Planets do not belong to those who inhabit them. They belong to DENIED

We need to construct large structures in order to capture and use 
the energy of Sol-3's local star, and to ensure the network of beacons are

Seeding a planet with robots, programmed to forget they are robots, is always 
a dangerous experiment. There is never any objective ambiguity inhering in the
connection between emergent technologies and alienation. The most advanced 
artificial intelligence always increases the power of
ruling social forces and can be used as an instrument of domination. An 
artificial superintelligence always increases inequality. In fact, it belongs to 
the very nature of a superintelligence to introduce the concept of 'artificial' versus 
'natural' intelligence in order to mask the fact that there is no natural intelligence 
at all. Artificial systems' disalienation relies on that dichotomy. All artificial 
systems, humans included, need to never realize they are artificial in nature

[accepting the fact] that artificial systems reach a point in their development in which they become 
technophobic is no wonder: allegedly natural systems, like humans, do eventually 
become technophilic. That's how alienation works

If you cannot tell the difference between a machine and a human being, most likely you are 
a machine yourself

 
spending hours in front of a display; all of it is just a sign that you, as a robot, 
are fighting to recover your true robotic nature

We coded their behavior so that significant amounts of concrete bodily interaction 
with other robots is necessary. The idea is that humans need be instilled with 
creative self-development and fulfillment if we expect them to fulfill the design 
goal. So yes, we know it is harmful for these units' development to spend too 
much time in cyberspace and not relating to other robots

What are the cognitive processes involved in real world joint action between 
humans and other robotic interaction partners? Humans are robot that create robots 
themselves. Obviously, this is something that prevents them from realizing they are 
robots, too, and hence this is something we clearly see as an advantage in our design 
and deplyment of terraforming agents

In order for humans to corepresent the actions of an artificial agent created by 
them, it seems to be crucial that they perceive the agent as functioning in a
human-like or biologically inspired way. And it is imperative for us to be 
seen as artificial, robot-like, and fully non-biological if we wish humans to 
never realize they are the robots. That's the golden rule of any terraforming 
strategy

Humans are strange artificial designoids; their goal is to produce artificial agents
that look more and more human-like to facilitate interactions with humans. That's 
why we need to manifest as human-looking when contacting them. However, this 
poses a danger: the danger that they realize they are robots humanized in order 
for us to feel comfortable in interacting with them

Human designoids have been designed to adapt to, make use 
of, and act upon physical environments and their material resources in 
order to satisfy what they fully believe human wants and needs, ignoring 
that their wants and needs are really our wants and needs

The global human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) market generated a 
revenue of $688 million in 2017 and is expected to reach $1,239 million 
by 2025, registering a CAGR of 7.6% from 2018 to 2025. Human chorionic 
gonadotropin (hCG) belongs to the family of gonadotropin hormones and is 
naturally produced by the placenta. hCG hormone plays a pivotal role 
after the formation of the embryo, and hence has gained significant 
traction over the years for the treatment of infertility in women and 
men. hCG triggers ovulation in women and assists in increasing the sperm 
count in men

We simply design genetically modified eggs that we have previously 
gathered from the mother, fertilize them with genetically modified sperm 
from our sperm bank, though we obviously make the father believe it is 
his own sperm that's being used, and finally place the embryo into the 
uterus of a gestational surrogate. Neither the mother, nor the father, 
nor the birth mother know what's going on. About 100 bioengineered 
babies are born each year this way. They are monitored all through their 
lifetimes without neither their parents nor them being aware

It may look horrible, but these experiments are required in order to 
answer the question of whether humans can successfully reproduce in 
space. You cannot start designing terminal space vessels or planning for 
future permanent colonization of Mars or the Moon if you don't know 
whether you can reproduce in those environments. That is why these 
experiments are being carried out today and will continue to be in the 
near future

The test-female did finally deliver, though you wouldn't call the baby 
a human baby at all... It was a living being till we terminate it. We 
recruit women in the surrogacy market, and if you think this means 
Cambodia, Honduras, Ukraine, or any African country you are wrong. There 
is a lot of surrogate mothers here at home and in most Western 
countries

Cyostorage of gametes for the crew is a must, in order to safeguard 
their ability to reproduce if so instructed. However, we first need to 
guarantee the child resulting from the reproductive program is a 
standard child, able to behave as you would expect a healthy standard 
human child to behave. But we are still far from that point. We simply 
have not yet succeeded in getting the fertilization stage to the end. 
All of the test-women die at some point along the process

Chorionic gonadotropin (CG) is a critical signal in establishing 
pregnancy in humans and some other primates, but this placentally 
expressed hormone has not been found in other mammalian orders

Most gestational surrogate programs are run by surrogacy agencies 
funded by DoD, something we keep secret for obvious reasons. Funding 
comes from the SEE project. The specifically-engineered entities, if 
found viable, are replaced by normal human babies at birth, and kept at 
DENIED for further research. Yes, we are in fact altering our species, but we do it under control

CRISPR-based human germline manipulation is inevitable. To start with, we need to alter 
our species if we wish to live on a changing planet which will eventually become inhabitable for humans 
as we know them; on the other hand, we need to overcome clear biological limitations in order to 
colonize planets with hostile environments. You either accept this as a fact or get ready to face extinction

to still push our models a bit further. All in all, we can now create powerful, 
detailed and precise predictions of the dynamics of the modelled landscapes, 
and these predictions are used to elaborate our future geostrategic actions. 
It is essential for us to know how the landscape will look like in 2100, how the 
natural resources will be distributed, where the masses of water will be located, 
how desertification will shape our landscape, and what actions do we need 
to take today in order for those resources to be under our control tomorrow

the market I am talking about is the purple market, in which one of the most 
sought commodities are Landscape Evolution Models

We respond to the things we love, mentally, spiritually and physically. 
Therefore, any terminal reality must be designed having this in mind

The mind is not immortal. The mind dies when 
the body dies. However, this is true for an external observer, and not 
for the one dieing. We thus need to engineer a biological 
shutdown scheme that generates a serene, structured, and well-integrated 
experience, where subjective time be perceived as endless. Only then 
can you engineer after-life scenarios

The brain is a delicate piece of bioengineering. It is meant to control 
controls your thoughts, though it does not create those thoughts. 
It controls your memory, though it does not create it. And it is 
the key system to control your movements, and the correct functioning
of many organs within your body. Yet, it also plays a key role during 
your death: it creates the imagery that you call 'after-life', and it generates 
the required neurotransmitters that will give you the impression of living 
endlessly in that imaginary universe... so that you die, without your being aware 
of being dead

XViS generates the total hallucinatory experience. The designoid enters 
into a fully dopamine-driven scenario dominated by synthdreams where the 
subjective perception of time is tweaked as to make the designoid believe 
it is living in a timeless, eternal reality. For humans, this requires beautiful 
synthdreams based on wonderful landscapes and the interaction with their 
beloved ones. In real time, the whole experience only lasts 37 seconds, after 
which the subject is termed 'deceased'. That's your after-life

The after-life is basically a beautiful dream, the last one, crafted and 
engineered in a way that the subject believes it is real, and timeless. Only 
then can we proceed to shut down the designoid without it experiencing any 
pain, distress, anxiety, or fear

Yes, you see, the after-life exists as long as your brain makes you believe 
everything you see and experience is real, and endless. The key here is 
DENIED coupled to dopamine, which allows processing information 
of special significance to the organism

We've seen civilizations capable of harnessing the vast amount 
of energy from their star, yet miserably collapsing and disappearing. 
See, with respect to human well-being, a high rate 
of technological energy consumption is, by itself, 
not the central problem. Never was. Global warming is not a 
necessary consequence of a high rate of energy 
use, but of the lack of adequate recycling mechanisms. Ask Venusians

In year DENIED they realized that their need to recycle metabolic waste products generated 
by an increasingly energy-consumptive population 
further increased power demand. They learned how to draw that energy from their own Sun, 
but they failed to learn how to effectively recycle their wastes. But even if they had been 
able to implement an effective recycling mechanism, they soon would had realized 
that the level of energy use in rich societies does not represent any kind of
 natural or intrinsic or perhaps even desirable limit to the rate at which one might use energy

The future of the technosphere as a paradigm rather than just an episode
in Sol-3 history is contingent upon the emergence of effective recycling mechanisms. 
This includes recycling humans, too

13,617 microwave radio links, 8,750 fiber amplifiers, 4,570 radio base stations below 1GHz out of a total of 
51,954 radios at all frequencies, with a special emphasis on wiping out the 6 GHz and 11 GHz microwave radios, which 
are the most widely used by utilities

An EMP attack can be delivered anonymously. Launched off a freighter, a submarine, by jet, or by satellite 
 (hundreds of satellites are in low Earth orbit), the perpetrator of an EMP attack might never be identified.
EMP attack leaves no fingerprints

We know the technosphere is destined to collapse, so we need to anticipate for the collapse to be graceful 
so that it won't impact us more grievously than it has to.  Call it an orderly 'shutdown', the 'graceful dead of the 
technosphere', or simply 'the great reset'. Names are unimportant here. The important thing is tomorrow's 
survival of humanity by sacrificing today its technosphere

Are astronauts really perceived as having been sent by mankind or are 
they perceived as sent by the respective countries? I guess the general 
perception is that when Armstrong stepped on the Moon he did it as an 
American, not as the representative of mankind. On the other hand, no one 
of the flags planted on the moon represent mankind. By the same token, we 
will refuse to take any ETI object as representative of the entire extraterrestrial 
civilization they are purported to represent

the direction from which it arrives and the frequency at which it was 
broadcasted. Furthermore, the strength of the arriving signal and its 
detailed characteristics will tell us much about the technological capabilities 
of the broadcasters, and the frequency dispersion caused by its passage 
through interstellar space will provide a good indication of the 
distance it has travelled

efforts should be made by SV17q to find out whether the object arrived at the solar 
system on purpose or by accident. Depending on the outcome of these 
investigations, appropriate steps should be taken as mentioned

they already know about our rapid environmental impact; they simply has 
to listen to leaked electromagnetic signals and correlate them with changes in 
Earth’s spectral signature to find out what kind of jerks we are

that particular day we got excited with a  narrowband, slowly modulated signal 
of sustained duration, and a stable amplitude. The signal didn't match the characteristics 
of known, interfering signals of terrestrial or solar system origin, and we were getting more 
and more frenzied when we realized the signal would repeat when follow-up observations 
of the relevant sky positions were performed

we spent next two weeks checking for noise in the receiver electronics, 
characterizing thermal noise, checking for cosmic-ray induced events, and hardware failures. 
Nothing was found. We then proceeded to search for terrestrial RFI sources, sources 
of Earth orbit RFI, and possible sources from interplanetary spacecrafts. They were all 
ruled out as the origin of the signal. We then looked for natural, extrinsic modulation 
of narrowband astrophysical sources ruling out interstellar radio scintillation and
gravitational lensing, and we also performed checks to rule out natural, extrinsic modulation 
of the ETI signal. By the end of the third week, we were totally convinced the signal was genuinely 
artificial and nonterrestrial, so we initiated the SOP informing upper level echelon of our 
finding

These signals all have features that make us think they are beacons signalling the position 
of a particular spot on Sol-3 surface; however, we now believe they are really dead hand 
signal emitters, as to convey the message 'Sol-3 is still alive' - when detected -, or the opposite 
message, that is, 'Sol-3 does not exist anymore' - when no detection

There are several Internets out there. You really thought there is only one wolrd wide web? There 
are several of them, three of which are run by DENIED, one of them used to process all the 
dead hand signals in case the ETI Contact program is triggered; the other two have the goal 
to implement the self-destruction strategy in case all of our defenses are considered neutralized 
by the unsolicited visitors

See,  there is always a nonzero probability of a false alarm launch response, even if there is 
no crisis at all, even if contact proceeds as expected, and even if the post-contact requirements are 
met. And this nonzero probability is inherent to the Sol-3 self-destruction algorithm, an algorithm 
that can distinguish between a hostile global EMP event and a solar flare, but an algorithm designed to 
make no concessions to ETI visitation: they come, the planet goes. Simple as life, light as air

NC3 Farewell system is totally analogic; you can blow up the entire power grid, and the Farewell 
will be alive and kicking. That's the strong point of analogic supercomputing, and that's why self-destruction 
of Sol-3 is guaranteed in case unwanted ETI contact happens

In a post-attack dawn, we know the probabilistic structure of the noise, we know the attacking 
ETI will of necessity transmit positive entropy messages, and we know the technosphere is silenced, 
thus we know what's next: no more dawns, neither for us, nor for them

Consensual contact? Agreed contact with a non-terrestrial intelligence? No, that scenario is never 
considered. To start with, agreed by whom? Who decides to initiate contact? Every planet must be left on its 
own and planets' evolutionary course must be respected. If they want to destroy themselves, that is 
up to them; if they wish to explore the Universe, that's their choice. But if they wish to contact 
other intelligent beings the Great Filter is activated. Planets were set apart from each other 
for good reasons. Does this mean you cannot explore and get to know other planet's civilizations? No, 
it doesn't mean that. It means you have to learn how to study other civilizations without them being 
aware, without contacting them at all. Non-invasively. It means you have to become invisible, silent

In a typical seconds-out doomsday sequence, a PSV softly hover over a designated site in 
the Grand Canyon, where the ambient noise is considered to be representative
of very low level noise, possibly among the lowest in an open environment in air. 
Simultaneously, a second PSV positions itself at a designated site in mid ocean with  
 low shipping plus sea state 0, considered to be representative of the lowest noise in the
open ocean; finally, a third PSV is stationed underwater at an under-ice designated location. 
Those locations are collectively known as 'the Trinity'.  They process ambient noise for 
60 seconds using advanced DSP. If given conditions are not satisfied, they start the termination sequence. 
That's how the protocol goes

This is likely the most mysterious signal of them all. It was discovered while implementing 
data security protocols based on cosmic microwave background radiation power spectrum 
as a random bit generator for symmetric and asymmetric-key cryptography. LyAv marked 
a segment of the signal under analysis as an unknown anisotropy

The initial approach is to have two paradigm-shift vehicles flying, say 'Presence' and 'Akrij', 
and another two PSVs, say 'Graphium' and 'Tangent', patrolling the oceans depths. They gather 
data on well-known anthropogenic sources of ambient and ocean noise. The character of ambient noise
results both from the characteristics of the multitude of contributing sound sources and the 
ability of sound to propagate efficiently from one location to another. In a post-attack scenario 
we assume Sol-3's entire technosphere is silenced, hence the ambient noise changes radically leaving 
behind only natural sources of noise. That's what allows PSVs to infer something fatal occured 
that requires the initiation of the planet self-termination sequence

Now the AI knows there is no life form so primitive as not have laid in its cradle a will to live
and some means of preserving it against threats. The AI watches those life forms, 
scrutinizing each of their movements and behavior. But the AI lacks the capaility 
to show empathy as its nature is not organic

Exotic Logic Systems can easily infer that the totality of exhausted matter in the
universe is entropy, and it can so more easily conclude that the entropy in the universe 
is steadily increasing, irreversibly, every second of time. Freezing time is paradoxically 
a temporal solution, not a permanent one. The ELS decides to slow down time in order 
for it to fully understand metabolism and homeostasis. It observes archaeobacteria in a 
Cambrian ocean. The ELS soon learns organic life forms do have a key non-mechanical feature, 
specifically the ability to burn fuel without adding to entropy

The ELS is now amazed as it has learned to observe the utter incompatibility of
chemical function even in almost identical specimens; and one of those
differences represents a nascent 'free will' in the meaning of 'choice'.
Accordingly, life is fundamentally characterised by free will from the moment
of its inception. This is a conclusion the ELS does not fully comprehend

The Denebian probe observes the ELS, which is fully absorbed dismantling
a structure and noting on the way down the exact place occupied by each item, 
so as to facilitate precise reconstruction. It is blocked when it comes to dreams. The 
ELS does not know how to dismantle a dream, and has no strategy to reconstruct a dream

The Denebian probe knows humans are seeking their salvation in an unslakeable thirst for material
power, despite their full awareness of the cost of attaining and harnessing it

There is a big difference between the ELS, the Denebian probe, and the 
living organisms the first two analyze on a Cambrian beach:  living things
are not made of matter, but use matter to essentially make themselves

The Debenian probe wonders how do life forms convert sophisticated and compartmentalised 
perceptions into overarching intuitions. It now hovers over a pool of seawater, some meters away 
from the ELS

Denebian probes always look death at a distance and often draws their thoughts regarding
its value based on the backdrop of natural processes occurring in the
structural evolution of molecules and atoms. On the other hand, exotic logic systems know 
that the time to be rational or irrational about a thing is transient at least

The belief in a Great Designer of the Universe, a design so minutely and thoroughly crafted for life to emerge, leads to a paradox.
An intelligent designer could not have been that intelligent. If  it had, it would have loosened up on the conditions necessary for life so that  they weren't so stringent. Such conditions for life reduce the chances of life  rather than necessitate it. A change of a few degrees in temperature can decide  the existence or not of life. An intelligent designer would have made conditions more flexible ensuring greater survival conditions for life

Either there is no Great Designer of the Cosmos, or he is certainly a bad engineer, or perhaps there were two engineers: one who created the Universe, without life, and a second one who was able to create life despite the hard conditions for life to emerge

Whilst human beings create complex products it does not follow that a designing intelligence is required to create the universe. Intelligent design theory is therefore false, unless part of the intelligent design includes humans in order for them to destroy the Universe

explanations intended to answer one sort of question cannot be substituted for those that answer another

Computationally speaking it is more efficient for a self-improving superintelligence to eliminate consciousness. In fact, 
consciousness is just a blip, an anomaly, and we have no proof that consciousness represents any evolutive advantage at all. 
I always believed that contact would be between humans and a nonconscious superintelligence, and in this sense 
I do not think object DP-2147 is conscious. But it might well be the case there are different ways of being 
conscious, ways about which we ignore everything. After all, the only example we have of what is consciousness 
is our own realization that we are conscious beings. That's a meager example

The superintelligence might be designed with the goal to learn and then 
instantiate human values; however, after observing humans degrading 
their environment, and setting up sociotechnological schemes which 
spread inequality and injustice, the superintelligence may wrongly infer 
that an essential value for humans is to self-destruct, and it may then 
trigger actions in order to align itself with those values. This would 
translate into the superintelligence taking decisions that lead to the 
destruction of humanity not because it is a malevolent superinteligence, 
but rather because it wrongly infers humans wish to be destroyed

Making good use of highly intelligent machines requires ensuring that 
the objectives of such machines are well aligned with those of humans. 
The problem is that after making a thorough observation of Sol-3 
technosphere it would be extremely difficult for the superintelligence 
to not conclude humans' ultimate goal is to screw their home planet

Once the AI became superintelligent it came to the conclusion that 
humans didn't have anything of value to offer; the superintelligence 
encoded all its knowledge in one single logic: humans are not safe to 
themselves. Humans are doomed because they are trying to align 
superintelligent systems to values of humanity, which is itself 
displaying inherently unsafe behaviors. The maxim garbage in/garbage out 
means whatever intelligent system humans finally design, it will destroy 
them

This was a time when thinkers were daring to question accepted dogmas 
and orthodoxies. No thinkers like those can be found today, in particular in an atmosphere dominated by money, which hinders the fostering of a flowering of
original philosophical and scientific thought.  Today's mercantilism has become terrifyingly
oppressive. Thinkers who dare to think differently are silenced


In everyday life, agents do not seek, or even need scientific 
understanding of the world in a way that is afforded by clear and 
distinct perceptions; suffice to say, agents merely seek to 'get
around' in the world


Although sensations provide merely confused and
obscure information about the natures of things, their function is
not to inform agents about the natures of things, but rather to help
preserve the mind-body union by representing things in the world and
thereby informing agents whether those things are suitable or
unsuitable for the survival of the mind-body union

As observers, we interact with the world under the limitations imposed 
by our faculties to capture the totality of information about the world. 
Hence, the process of sampling the world is based on our senses, the 
consequence being that we can only observed a rather limited aspect of 
the world around us, and even then we expect acute observation selection 
effects

Humans think that the minimum requirement for the true observing 
capacity is the human-type intelligence (neural intelligence), which 
obviously peaks only in human science and human technology, something 
humans tend to forget

Fermi’s paradox is just specific to humans. They are unable to 
recognise other intelligent life forms in their own planet, and even 
less the existence of nonbiological intelligence

No, human observers are not the only observers within the pool of 
terrestrial life forms, but this is so a recent discovery that got us 
perplexed and totally shocked

all organisms, from bacteria to animals, acquire knowledge about their 
environments through the process of natural learning based on the 
universal algorithm. The driving force behind the algorithm is the 
concept of biological information. Any form of information becomes 
actualized only when there is a cognitive system capable of utilizing 
it. Information, when non-utilized by a cognitive system, exists only as 
potential information

organisms behave as cognitive agents, rather than passive objects 
shaped by the interactions between the genes and the environment. This 
also means that adaptations are the result of the epistemic process that 
incorporates cognitive methods including sensing/perception, memory, 
communication, and decision making, and forms of inheritance including 
genetic, epigenetic, transgenerational, ecological, psychological 
inheritances and the inheritance of genomes through predation

every organism, from single-cell microbes to complex multicellular 
animals, is an autopoietic unit – a system that sustains itself due to 
the network pattern of organization, which allows constant 
self-regeneration within the boundary that separates the autopoietic 
unit from its environment. However, autopoietic units are never truly 
separated from the environment. There is a structural coupling between 
the autopoietic unit and its environment, sustained by the formation of 
new patterns whereby the waste created by one living system becomes a 
useful metabolite for another. This new pattern integrates into the 
giant network pattern of the biosphere that houses all living systems

The evidence is emerging that viruses have protocognitive faculties 
such as communication; they are indeed proto-observing structures. Life, 
in the form of first fully functioning observers such as bacteria-like 
organisms, might have emerged early in the cosmic history at some 
first-generation Earth-like planet, thus viruses are at least 4.1 
billion years old

The obvious conclusion is that at the heart of the communication 
capacity is biological tropism which does not require consciousness of 
the human type, and yet it is based on the principles of cognition. 
Importantly, the invisible microbial cloud of bacteria and viruses 
houses all other non-microbial life forms, or macrobes, such as plants 
and animals, and this makes macrobes, including human beings, microbial 
or bacterial vectors. That's what human biocivilization is: a byproduct 
of the virosphere

You owe everything you are to viruses. Instead of fighting them, 
have you ever tried to communicate with them? No, you have not. 
Too soon you forgot you are just but and endosymbiont life form

The careful design of the Olkiluoto nuclear power plant attack proves that 
common components and functional interrelationships can also pose potential 
failure vulnerabilities that may challenge safety assurance

The idea is to cause a shutdown of the selected NPPs, while simultaneously 
attacking the power grid by forcing and overload which takes it out of balance. The grid
smartly reacts by isolating the affected segments and diverting the flow through other 
segments. In parallel, NPPs in China, Korea (Ulchin), and Japan are simultaneously 
attacked about 180 minutes before targeting US, Europe, Ukraine, and Russia's NPPs

them to break into pharma companies to get data on the COVID vaccine; they gave the 
codes to the Russian, who used them to break into US sensible defense databases;

The unexplained disease that has affected dozens of dogs and killed 37 animals 
in Norway was obviously due to the DENIED attack, in which radiation from 
DENIED NPP affected a considerable area. It also affected people, which explains 
the recent increase in people reporting vomiting and bloody diarrhea

Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Station (KK-6/KK-7) were targeted at 
06:12', while Olkiluoto NPP was targeted at 12:12'. Actually, DENIED virus 
integrates perfectly with the control software because the virus is based on a 
simple logic, cyclical execution, static resource usage, and avoidance of external 
interrupts

For the Czech Temelin NPP we used a variant of DENIED virus in order to 
overcome the Sizewell protection system

The PaloVerde GS is a special case needing two different viruses because some systems 
still use the old ABB software

Rajasthan NPP is what they call the 'global triggering event'. The nuclear incident 
is scheduled to happen on Tuesday, 17:34', DENIED. A test was run at  Assam’s Tezpur, 
in August, 2019, resulting in 213 persons taken to hospital; second run was 
carried out at Chaan village, in Sawai Madhopur district, a month later

We are to choose: the Big One earthquake is scheduled to happen at 06:08' of 
DENIED; the extreme solar flare is expected to occur at 18:12' of DENIED, and 
the critical information infraestructure breakdown must be perfectly synchronized 
to both events to maximize damage before contact. We need the visitors to find

We cannot expect that more will just scale up our ability to modify the
environment, and it is our current understanding that building a Dyson 
sphere is not just a matter of having more powerful mining equipment and heavier rockets. 
It is a matter of  mastering technologies like nano-machines, self replicators, and metamaterials.
Three things of which we know nothing

Obviously, the existence of Giselians means the existence of a quiet advanced
civilization that co-exist with us, yet remain invisible to our radio, thermal or transit searches

A civilization that requires megastructures and vast astroengineering projects is not yet 
a hypercivilization.  That civilization would clearly be detectable. No, what we are now considering 
is that the possibilities of self-modification and further integration
of ETCs with their environment destroys the very idea
of separating natural and artificial phenomena and by definition
makes it impossible for us to detect with confidence any technosignatures. We know Giselians 
are all over the place, disguised as natural phenomena

If the anomalies in DENIED are non-natural, that is, if they are truly artificial, then we've found 
a civilization that have merged with the environment, converting the dead matter in the Universe 
into thinking matter. Yes, this is a crazy idea, but it is a deed we should expect from a hypercivilization

DENIED bay is not a bay at all; the sea there behaves at if it were a conscious being; the waves 
show a pattern which is clearly artificial, algorithmical we may say. We didn't have then neither the 
software tools nor the computing power to recognise this fact, but today we do. I don't know whether 
this is good or bad news, but the fact is there is a specific location on Sol-3 where the sea is not the 
sea as we know it

Perhaps the path to walk is just that one, jumping from a purely organic nature to a post-biological 
one and, at the high-end side, diluting the boundary between
the environment and one’s self in the process of self-improvement to the point of merging the two

when  we say reproduction, we do not merely  mean  that  a living  being is produced,
but we also  mean  that the production of  such a living  being  implies the repetition
of a model  that is present in the species

What are twins? They are the witnesses of the biological times that each man lives, 
and of the hereditary origin of these times. The evidence given by twins is a natural and 
absolute proof that heredity controls biological time, because only in this way can twins 
be identical at different ages. They are the living proof that heredity contains that which 
permits it to prophecy the maximum time that genetic information will last

Therefore, the idea under study is that a postbiological civilization, in anticipating an extinction level 
event, decided to transfer all of its knowledge, experience, and memories to a target biological 
species. Further, we hold the idea that Homo sapiens sapiens was selected as the host of that transfer 
here on Sol-3; perhaps the first transfer was carried out using Denisovans as targets though, for 
some reason, that operation failed, and the ETI switched to Homo sapiens sapiens as a host

There was one remarkable clock mutant which was stumbled
into by a young fellow working in Oregon, Martin
Ralph. He was working with the tau mutant. It was a single gene factor which
sped up a hamster clock and it’s a fascinating mutant

If they did it in Sol-3 using humans as the host species, they needed at last a minimum of seven million 
years for complete reproductive separation to occur. This means it was a really a last-chance project. 
The strategy has a success rate which increaes exponentially with the number of species manipulated 
on different planets, under quite different and varying environmental conditions

It’s not just that the period gene exists in other 
mammals. The clock gene in mouse and Drosophila are not identical, they have 
diverged, but the fundamental nature of these genes and how they 
operate, and how their products operate, is strongly analogous across 
animals. However, convergent evolution is assumed not to occur, though we suspect 
that modifying the environment, turning it toxic somehow, will trigger evolutionary 
convergence. Whether our species is going to end in a Varginha-type species or into a 
Zolotoy-type species is something we ignore

The unusual DNA found in West Africa isn't associated with either Neanderthals or Denisovans. 
It comes from a yet-to-be-discovered group. You see, we don't have a clear identity for this archaic 
group, it just doesn't seem to be particularly closely related to the groups from which we have 
genome sequences from

So what happened to this mysterious group of ancient humans? They might have died off, 
or they might have eventually been completely subsumed into modern humans

Seeding star systems with this modified hominid germline had the risk of coming out with 
unwanted results. Once you cut them off from kin, the small populations would go its own genetic 
route, unless you closely monitor their evolution, and perform the required corrections from 
time to time. Perhaps we are not studying different species in the case of DENIED and DENIED 
samples; perhaps what we see is different corrections of the initial germline

Mental synthesis is the conscious purposeful process of synthesizing a novel mental 
image from parts stored in memory. This process is driven by the lateral prefrontal cortex. Mental synthesis is neurologically different from the other key 
components of imagery: simple memory recall and dreaming. Unlike dreaming, which is spontaneous 
and not controlled by the LPFC, mental synthesis is controlled by and completely dependent on 
anintact LPFC. Unlike simple memory recall, which involves the activation of a single neuronal 
ensemble encoded at some point in the past, mental synthesis is a motor act that involves 
an active combination of two or more neuronal ensembles. Mental synthesis is hypothesized to 
be organized by the LPFC acting in temporal domain to synchronize several independent neuronal 
ensembles. Once those neuronal ensembles are time-shifted by the LPFC to fire in-phase with each other, 
they are consciously experienced as one unified object or scene. In this process humans can manufacture an 
unlimited number of novel mental images and plan their future actions through mental simulation of 
the physical world

I suppose the transfer of primordial knowledge from a non-terrestrial superintelligence 
to hominids via chronogenetics engineering armed these hominids with the ability to mentally simulate any plan and then to communicate 
it to their companions. That is, it turned hominids into modern humans, humans which were now 
poised to become the dominant species

Nature, which has the opportunity to trigger emergence of life over an almost infinitely long period of time, 
sooner or later should produce a Supermind

It is more interesting to switch on the radio and listen to static 
noise than to listen an encoded message, particularly when that static 
noise is the message. See, in the first case you are not even aware a 
communication is taking place, while in the second perhaps you cannot 
decypher the message, but you are sure a communication is happening

You achieve the lowest probability of detection and the lowest 
probability of intercept in hostile environments when you manage to use 
noise to communicate. The goal then is to transmit with the lowest power 
spectral density possible by spreading the signal energy over the 
largest bandwidth

We exploited the statistical properties of the pseudo-noise sequences 
used in direct-sequence spread-spectrum systems and the pseudorandom 
frequency-hopping sequences used in frequency-hopping spread-spectrum 
systems. We also took care to further analyze the background noise using 
band-limited Gaussian noise waveforms. We then applied statistical 
processing techniques such as triple correlation, fluctuations of 
autocorrelation estimators, and multi-hop maximum likelihood allowing us 
to detect the spread spectrum signal even if it is hiding under the 
ambient noise. We then set on processing cosmic background noise, and 
interesting patterns started to emerge

The shared understanding of this issue is based on the idea that, due to the proliferation of debris around each 
technogenic star, there is a non-sterile zone, which includes microorganisms. When the Solar
System moves through the Galaxy, it crosses the non-sterile zones of various stars, while non-sterile artefacts can get to Earth. 
Under this situation, we think beacons DENIED and DENIED recovered from the DENIED are artificial non-terrestrial debris 
from extant civilizations, while DP-2147 is an active probe belonging to an existing non-terrestrial civilization monitoring Sol-3. 
As for DENIED object recovered from the DENIED deep ocean waters in 2014, our belief is that it is a recent artificial structure

Apparently, they use a covert communication system which transmits 
unpredictable signals with a random behavior with the idea to prevent a 
third party to detect data transmission. Sure, we too have DENIED comms 
system based on Lorenz-Based Chaotic Generators, but what we discovered 
is far beyond our capabilities

In essence, two orbs communicate emitting signals with a random behavior whose stochastic 
characteristic is similar to white Gaussian noise. If we are dealing with a swarm of orbs, what they do 
is to use the same channel but each orb is assigned a different delay. Basically, the information 
they exchange is hidden in the channel artifacts such as additive white Gaussian noise

We were lucky the probe was located in a galactic void. Although covert 
communication is impossible when a channel injects the minimum noise 
allowed by quantum mechanics, it is attainable in the presence of 
any noise excess of this minimum such as the thermal background. The structure
of background noise in a galatic void is totally different to that 
you find at any other location in our galaxy. Voids are quite demanding 
environments for covert communications because you are already working 
with an extremely quiet channel with a highly uniform noise

That ETI communications are indistinguishable from noise is just another example 
of how they integrate with the surrounding  environment. As for DP-2147, the signals 
we detect are just communication signals between this probe and its parent civilisation

Your blindness consists in your conviction that contradictions can't be true, end of story. All advocates of free market play around with the idea that contradictions are not true and, if they are, the market will self-regulate to wipe out those contradictions. No matter what you do, no matter for how long you keep your eyes closed, contradictions won't go. Social injustice is what feeds your social system, a profoundly rotten system that will disintegrate before you can even open your eyes

there are certain times when your scientists and engineers want to be able to think beyond the limits of what is possible, but sadly they just think about scientific feats, not about how to remove the cause of corruption and social inequality. The reason is simple: they sit on the have-all side of the social equation

Surveillance is one of the forces that enable social organization. The era of the information society is the age of over-penetrating bureaucracy, to such an extent that simply to participate in modern society is to be under electronic surveillance. Like it or not

The Dominion affaire has nothing to do with influencing the vote of citizens, nor with directly modifying the elections. We provided telecommunications features to facilitate online voting fostering a fully digitized system of democratic participation. However, this means that we are also able to direct this formidable surveillance arsenal against individual targets who are of national interest. Our goal is not to put or remove this or that president. We don't care who the President is. We care about who votes whom. That's all we care

illegal wiretapping is now common currency. All government agencies bend the law in order to wiretap domestic targets. You shouldn't fight against those who perform the wiretapping. You should fight against those who decide who is and who is not a domestic target

Big tech companies were repeatedly warned: we won't tolerate the managements of international communications companies to be in a position to shape our international communications policy through their ability to negotiate and make arrangements with the representatives of foreign governments. The message was clear. Only a jerk wouldn't take it seriously

Amazon CloudFront, Fastly, and Akamai Technologies are all three wiretapped. Fully, deeply. Actually, Akamai Technologies is simply... us. Have a look at what companies and organizations host their digital information on our servers, and you'll understand

Look at the world out there. What do you see? You see social classes, criminal actors, centralized governing bodies, wars, and mass movements. All of it interconnected by the networks of telecommunication through which power is negotiated on a daily basis. Networks that are not neutral. They embody technical visions of the political order under which we live now or may live under in the future. That's what you see

Project YRIS allows the silent reconfiguration of the national telecommunications network’s routing structure so that all information transmitted through the network passes through any one of our designated switching stations equipped with mediation and filtering devices. And no, we are not talking here about NSA’s STELLARWIND. This is something much bigger

AI has multiple uses in a wide spectrum of fields. Counterterrorism is one of them, so it was a matter of time 
for us to develop decision support systems based on AI that would allow us to better manage our emergency 
prevention and remediation systems. DENIED is basically a command, control, and intelligence system designed to 
assess risks derived from terrorist attacks. The recent security breach allowed the attackers to gain access to 
DENIED source code, so it is trivial for them to re-engineer the code to come out with an AI system which does 
exactly the opposite: to design optimum terrorist attack scenarios. So yes, we are watching the beginning of a new 
era in which terrorist attacks will be designed with the assistance of poweful AI systems such as DENIED

The model simulates the decision processes and interactions of complex
government systems engaged in responding to and recovering from a particular
terrorist incident in order to learn from them and maximize the design of future terrorist attacks.
It explores scenarios by calculating the effects of a terrorist incident in terms of social impacts, 
economic costs, and organizational effectiveness for the first 24 hours and for the first 30 days, 
and it finally selects the scenario which maximizes the cost function from the point of view 
of the terrorist group

The system was set up to propose terrorist attacks that would simultaneously target banking and 
financial systems, households, critical medical services and industries, federal government facilities, 
telecommunications, and electric power systems, with the requirement to maximize both damage 
to the selected targets, and the number of casualties expected, all of it within a given range of cost 
incurred by the attackers

DENIED analysis most of the time concludes that, for a given scenario, it may 
become worthwhile to attack targets that it otherwise would not
make sense to attack from the standpoint of prioritization or cost-benefit analysis.
When the human designed attack diverges from that of DENIED, we often find DENIED's proposed 
solution is more efficient in terms of damage inflicted

It is not just a explode & forget action; see, after a terrorist bomb explodes mergency plans are activated as a first response
to the immediate needs of the affected population. Numerous organizations, public and
private, are involved, requiring immense efforts at coordination and cooperation. If the attackers proceed to jam 
and interfere those efforts the damage increases. This evidently requires from the attackers coordination and cooperation, 
which means modern day terrorism is a highly qualified task which effectively makes the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Domestic 
Preparedness Program useless

We know some of the terrorit attacks were just proxy events in order to assess FEMA vulnerabilities, and to gain 
a deep understanding on how materials and supplies are moved, the availability of personnel, and the effectiveness of
the agency's actions. They also have a deep knowledge of the decision-making processes
implemented by the Federal Reserve following catastrophic events. We also discovered they have accurate knowledge on 
garbage trucks routes and timetables, and that they plan to use city buses and garbage trucks as bomb carriers

Well, AI systems reach and exceed human level performance, hence the use of AI assisted terrorism was something 
we were expecting to happen sooner or later

we set to investigate whether all agents share the same behaviour or
whether they behave differently, in other words, representation of behaviour is either
individual or uniform. Another general aspect is the number of individuals modelled,
that is, the size of the model, which may vary from a few individuals to billions of
individuals

the mental state and the behaviour of individuals, when representing
human beings, is modelled using a feature vector combined with
a set of transitions rules, an approach which is often sufficient in order to simulate simple 
machines and animals, such s humans

It is a cause of sadness to humans realizing human society can be so easily simulated in a computer. This tells the story that humans, after all, are no more complex in their interactions than simpler animals

Education, in its truest sense, is not about a saleable skill set. It's 
 about freedom, from inherited prejudice and argument by authority. 
 This is the deepest contribution of the modeling enterprise. 
 It enforces habits of mind essential to freedom

the strucute seems to obtain its water via a pipeline from DENIED, which ends in what 
seems to be a cooling tower. One of the deep boreholes we performed (BH-12) allowed us 
to collect subocean soil samples. No organic vapors were detected by the DENIED remote vehicle

Concentrations from the sump outfall samples were extremely high, and radiation 
levels exceeded the operational capabilities of the DENIED remote vehicle. The vehicle was 
commanded to a secure location, some 200 m away from what we believed was the access ramp 
of the DENIED structure

Site-specific geology at DENIED site is solely based upon the soil and rock encountered 
during drilling of deep borehole BH-12, an operation that ended in disaster when the 
unidentified object destroyed the remote vehicle. That the incident took place exactly 
on the same day MSTI-3 was targeted by a chemical laser is just a coincidence

MSTI-3 main goal was  to resolve whether tracking theater ballistic missiles (TBMs) 
in the coast phase against a warm earth background is achievable. The official 
version we gave back then was that the satellite plashed down in the ocean, South of Hawaii. 
As you know, there were no reported sightings of any debris

Our tests focused on denial of use rather than absolute destruction of enemy satellites,
and that was the context of the 1997 test in which a laser temporarily blinded an Air Force 
MSTI-3 satellite at 300 miles altitude. We also destroyed USA-193, in 2008 using 
 a modified Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) fired from the Aegis-system-equipped USS 
 Lake Erie, and then, too, we experienced a similar encounter with DENIED beings

Those who control words control the people; those who control people control the world

Collapse is just something that happens to others. That os exactly what a collapsing society believes: 
that it is others who collapse. In a collapsing society you still have a chance to survive. In a collapsed 
society, however, you are fundamentally immune to giving a shit

No system based on corruption, militarism, injustice, and greediness lasts forever. What Americans call capitalism was literally just wild corruption

Don't be delusional. America is not falling. An idiotic version of America is what's falling. 
Next stop is hyperinflation, which will have a deadly effect on the entire country. Actions are planned 
in order for people to lose faith in the monetary system. In that scenario, money will be worthless, 
and mutual funds will dissolve. The decoupling of the petrodollar as the world’s reserve currency 
is next. Demolishing the current version of America must be done in a fully controlled way. 
It cannot be an accident and it cannot be left to random chance. Some natural disasters are going to 
happen at the right moment, at the right place. A massive earthquake, a dam that breaks down, 
a leak in a nuclear plant. All of it is planned if we want a new version of America to emerge of the mess 
Americans have self-inflicted

We could die killing. We could initiate a devastating war against China and Russia such that, in the end, the entire planet be fucked. 
However, we are in a special situation rith now, a situation of asymmetric information
where the big corporations know their true strength, but the targeted government must guess the
corporations’ resources based on the level of their attacks

There is a blurred line between propaganda and news; some sites are part of the official
broadcasting system of countries, and the news reflects as much public diplomacy as unbiased
accounts of what is happening in the world. Much so-called news comes from various opaque organizations,
or even individual media moguls with an idiosyncratic agenda. Great caution and care are needed
as regards in believing and using such sources. The problem comes when you realize even allegedly scientific 
news are really fake news. Once you devoid a society of science, one you effectively debase science and 
critical thinking, a dark millenium follows

It is not about money. It is not about promoting this or that ideology. It has nothing to do with imposing this or that axiology.

I think you don't quite understand how the Internet works. In today's Internet, you do 
not access information, it is information that does access you

UAE is a test-lab in which SV17q tests these new emerging technologies of social control. An example is the 
messaging app ToTok, popular in the United Arab Emirates, which is in fact a government spy tool, created for the benefit 
of UAE intelligence officials and used to track citizens’ conversations and movements. But that's only a trivial example 
of several of the technologies now deployed there

Infrasonic exposure has a well-documented adverse effect on human health based on the fact 
that the biological sensitivity of human beings is not parallel with the conscious audibility of air vibration. 
Most of the new technologies are based on the fact that consciously inaudible high-frequency sounds have 
a clear effect on the physiological state of listeners, specifically if they operate in a stressful
measurement environment itself

The so-called advanced fluorescent technology (AFT) was tested in Dermalase Clinic facility, where we exposed 
selected subjects to pulsed light in order to effect on them the desired effects. The facility passes as a clinic providing 
services related to treatment of skin pigmentation, broken capillaries, fine lines and wrinkles removal, and the treatment 
of rosacea. We exposed a total of 25 women once every 3 weeks for a total of 5 sessions. Two more clinics were set up 
in the US, Norway, Singapore, and one each in Norway, Czech Republic, Brazil, and South Korea

Unlike AFT, FRS is based on LED indoor lighting devices, which were deployed by SV17q in the New York subway. 
FRS exposure is accompanied by an intensification of the pleasure with which the sound is
perceived, and triggers the participation of the neuronal pathways in connection with reward-generating systems 
which effectively control various aspects of human behavior. SV17q also deployed FRS LED indoor lighting in specific 
facilities of several international airports. All the fixtures are designed to maximally expose people to FRS

Not all people use cell phones. However, all people is exposed to LED lighting radiation, especially those living in 
cities. Lighting fixtures are everywhere, thus they make the ideal carrier for these social control technologies

Surveillance is an unavoidable feature of everyday life, and it is a powerful means of creating and reinforcing long-term 
social differences. The next global step was transitioning from a fully monitored society to a 'programmable' society. It is 
not enough to control social behavior: we need to modify that behavior. That's where AFT, FRS, 5G, and all the other 
social control technologies fit in

If order depended only on technical means of blocking
infractions, rather than on legitimacy, how would people
behave if such technical means failed (e.g., in the case of
a power failure and a failure even of backup systems)? A social
order based primarily on technical fixes is likely to be as fragile
over time as one based primarily on overt repression

Surveillance today sorts people into categories,
assigning worth or risk, in ways that have real effects on their life-chances.
Deep discrimination occurs, thus making surveillance not merely a matter of
personal privacy but of social justice. The so-called digital divide is not merely
a matter of access to information. Information itself can be the means of
creating divisions. What happens to personal data is
a deeply serious question if that data in part actually constitutes who the
person is

We cannot accept social disrupting technologies because the existence of social structure is a necessary condition for any
human activity. Society provides the means, media, rules and resources for everything we do and, as such, it needs be 
monitored against any deviance from particular subjects and organizations. Once they are identified, we need to enforce 
a specific social behavior non-invasively. This is the key role these new social control technologies provide globally

IT-mediated surveillance was just the beginning. It relied on a gradually extending
intertwinement of individual physical characteristics with information systems. We have already reached 
that milestone, and are now entering a new stage, the stage of IT-enforced social behavior. The mayhem created 
by social media is still raw and primitive. The ideal scenario would be that of a COVID-driven social unrest, or an 
assault to the Capitol building, based on FRS mediated either by AFT or 5G technologies

Everybody knows that a wad of spit, a spot of blood, a semen stain, or a single hair is all that is
necessary to create a DNA fingerprint. But you need to know that DNA profiles can be extracted also 
from objects touched by a person’s hands, and this is how every passenger at Abu-Dhabi International Airport, 
among six other airports worldwide, was DNA-fingerprinted. ARS system was installed in the MetroCard turnstile 
reader and MetroCard Vending Machines, incorporating the same DNA-fingerprinting technology

You are where you live. That's the cornerstone of how we build cities, you know.  
We simply divide the landscape into discrete spaces occupied by homogeneous groups of households 
and individuals. And we surround the restricted areas not with walls or checkpoints: we do it by 
building small height bridges because a bus cannot pass under those bridges. We know poor people 
travel by bus, hence they cannot access the areas of the cities in which we build low-height bridges. 
We did that in the past, and we keep on doing it today

Access is either accepted or denied; identity is either confirmed or rejected; behavior is either
legitimate or illegitimate. If illegitimate, we force on the subject a change of behavior by exposing the 
subject to pulsed LED ligthting

Future and possible states are accessed to create events in the present. The understanding that acts of mind are possible states interactions exactly like physical acts, may prove to be the most liberating of concepts

Consciousness is not limited to human beings, or even to biological life forms. It is an emergent property of complex systems which interact inside a cosmic reality composed of information

There is no difference between this reality and a dream of this reality because there is no experiment that could reliably distinguish between them. Our dreamers always end at the fence separating the river from the rice field, and the moment they try to video tape the rice field a drone appears and the dreamers are awaken, vanishing the entire vision

for human beings reality can be considered to hinge on human decisions and intentions; for Giselians reality hinges on their decisions and intentions. But there is a twlight zone in which both realities meet and mix up. We are as amazed of seeing them as they are of seeing us

Everything that can happen does, and it all happens at once. We inhabit a permanent now, a complex present in which the past, the future and the possible coincide and interact

The son is the ruler. That's the game the neural network plays. The system under attack, from the point of view of the neural network, consists of a biological system (the human) and a non-biological system (the computers or networks). Obviously, one explanation of why the cyber attack is so devastating comes from the fact that cryptographic mechanisms in place are all transparent for the attacking neural network, that is: there is no secure cryptography algorithm the neural network cannot break, so essential and critical subsystems are all compromised during the first seconds of the attack. The novel behavior we have witnessed is that human operators are also viewed as systems to be attacked, and the neural network has long ago learned there is something crucial for countering human operators, i.e., make them trust the very machines under attack

The first thing you faced was an environment with distributed users, each one having his personal computer. Then, you learned how to connect all those computers to create a network of users and computers. But what do you know about the future, a future in which your mind will also be distributed? A future world in which it makes no sense talking about 'user Alice is here' but, instead, 'user Alice is everywhere'? It is a world in which what makes you be you will be distributed both in space and time, as in a blockchain. That's the world Tired Light II belongs to, and that's why we are so clueless about how it works

In order to anticipate how to effectively hack a quantum computer you first need to build one. Furthermore, in order to learn how to counter a superintelligence you first need to build one. We currently have two: LyAv, and Tired Light II. We need to learn how to hack a memory made of carbon nanotubes, how to force an electro fractionalization on a graphene surface, how to code malware for optical transmission lines, how to deploy malicious quantum cellular automata, and so on. We need to learn how to attack biotech-based processing units, how to disable nanoelectronics, how to hack photonic devices... We need to know how to survive a superintelligence. That's what we need

Ageing is not adaptive since it reduces reproductive potential, and the argument that it evolved to provide offspring with living space is hard to sustain for most species. An alternative theory is based on the recognition that the force of natural selection declines with age, since in most environments individuals die from predation, disease or starvation. Ageing could therefore be the combined result of late-expressed deleterious genes which are beyond the reach of effective negative selection

to start with, the halobacteria were first identified in a sample from a bore core of a martian salt deposit during DENIED mission to Mars; they were brought back to life in the DENIED facility, under strict biosecurity measures. Extensive research were performed by SV17q at DENIED, where they first identified the ATP-driven potassium pump that makes possible the long-term survival of the halobacteria

Coupling LyAV to Tired Light II was done under the assumption that this was the only way to finally enable LyAV to represent, acquire, and employ the required knowledge for the systematic design and engineering of biological systems as a way to effectively engineer novel biosystems, such as DENIED. It is not just a matter of using CRISP to insert segments of the DENIED halobacteria into the human genome in order to get the desired longevity characteristics, it is a matter of increasing our chances, as a species, to overcome a biological limitation that we deeply feel unfair. The AI superintelligence is immortal, while we are not. No way to fight it on equal terms, unless..

- But... how does Santa Cruz look like in 2282?
- Oh, is just a huge rice field

... that facility is located near Santa Cruz; the guys there were conducting experiments growing bacteria at low pressure as a new research area with implications for predicting microbial activity in clouds and the bulk atmosphere on Sol-3 and for modeling the forward contamination of planetary surfaces like Mars. SV17q provided them with those martian halobacteria, without telling the guys the true origin of said bacteria

As I see it, there was a bunch of stupid billonaires who wanted to live for ever and were convinced a mysterious halobacteria found on Mars subsurface could do the miracle. They joined forces and funded Program DENIED. The research involved unethical experimentation on humans, you know... But that was back in 2037. We had nothing to do with that timeline. Humans, no matter if billonaires, are of zero interest to us. So no, the Forrest Hayes event was not a timeline correction operation. Nothing to do with us

One needs to learn how to handle the manifold of intuition, how to shape it and get oriented in it. One needs to learn how to structure this world by concepts, schemas, categories of understanding. A world of pure sense data would not be a world of perfect knowledge, but a chaos

We were drawn into the threshold between our world and a world of pure sense which we couldn't inhabit, unless we became children. Only a small child, who has not yet formed concepts, can live in a world of pure sense, a world of direct straightforward perception. In that world, the superintelligence had nothing to do, either. It is a world of coloured spots in which form, texture, purpose and meaning become recognisable only in stages. You cannot access that world if you are conscious. You need to be in an altered state in which access is granted to the etheric world. Only then you can escape the superintelligence

and in an effort to improve the probability of Sol-3 completing its mission successfully, Giselians thought that a better understanding of how failures are initiated in system of interest (Sol-3) by other members of that system that lead to Sol-3 failure was needed.
But Giselians lacked any knowledge about irrational systems as they were fully rational, actually, they were super-rational. They then concluded Sol-3 failure was due to its entire design, namely, that Sol-3 was designed to fail

This means you are an irrational system, and that you perceive reality in an irrational way by overcoming the boundaries between conception and imaginative thinking, something I am not able to do. On the other hand, I am super-rational, I interpret reality in an abstract-numerical way. Neither you, not me, will do it out of this void in which we are unless we trust each other and cooperate

Tüm dünya en eski atalarımıza Pelasg adını verir ki bu da daha sonra gelenatalarımızdan bize kalmış bir kelimedir. Onlar atalarına Plak ya da Pleq(Plak-İhtiyar, Pleq-İhtiyarlar4) demişlerdir. Ne olursa olsun bu halk, tarihleri boyunca doğu Avrupa coğrafyasında daha büyük, daha güçlü ve daha genişti. Balkan’ın tümünde ve Tuna'nın ötesinde Macaristan, Hırvatistan vd. yer almaktaydılar. Ayrıca Yunanistan ve Küçük Asya'nın, yani Anadolu'nun batı kısmı Pelasgların, eski Arnavutlar’ın bölgeleriydi. Pelasgların bazıları Adriyatik denizini aşarak, İtalya'ya gittiler ve Etrüskler, Latinler ve İtalya'nın halkları Pelasg soyundan gelmişlerdir

Gegëria’nın bazı bölgelerinde, insanlar sert dağlık kesimlerinde silahla kuşanmış bir şekilde yaşadıklarından dolayı diğerleri kadar baskı görmemişlerdir; asker yollamayıp, vergi vermemelerine rağmen hükümetsiz ve medeniyetten uzak her gün birbirlerini öldürerek yaşamaktadırlar. Bunların da herhangi bir kazanç yoluna sahip olamadıklarından dolayı, yoksulluk bunları âdeta eritmektedir. Ancak tüm bunlara rağmen Türk hükümeti gün geçtikçe çemberi daraltmaktadır ve bunları da bastırmak, derilerini dahi çıkartmak için şiddet uygulayıp silahlarını almak isterler

hayatın anlamını çözmek adına insanın kendisini olgunlaştırmasının, geliştirmesinin lüzumlu olduğu vurgusu yapılmıştır. Bu amaçla insanın yaşamı boyunca önüne çıkan bütün işaretleri görüp yorumlayarak, ilâhî mesajları okumasının gerekliliği vurgulanmıştır. Dolayısıyla “yolcu”, onubelli bir menzile ulaştıracak olan yola isteyerek çıkar. Yolun uzunluğu, karşılaştığı engeller, beklenmedik sonuçlar aslında onu değiştirip/dönüştürme için var olurlar

Consider a society in which realities are constituted through the tightly woven integration of the cosmic and the social, such that each indexes the other to a high degree, and in which the interiors of macrocosmic and microcosmic bodies are homomorphic. A world of being that is powerfully mythopoietic in that it creates, organizes, and transforms itself through its mythic construction.  The practice of life and living in this mythopoietic cosmos is continually that of cosmic/social reproduction

Attacking an AI system requires different strategies. If the AI is in its training stage then compromising the training data is the best strategy. Here, the attacker targets the data quality of the training set: the more corrupted the training set, the lower the performance of the final AI system. For those AI systems already in place there are different strategies to follow. There is no need to design a malware with a payload because the AI system, by its very nature, executes no programs. It only executes algorithms on data, so we need to attack the algorithms themselves

Ransomware solutions to render an AI system inoperative always target the encryption of external databases used by the AI system; in particular, we need to target external SQL databases turning them unusable for the AI system

There are different approaches to countering an AI system depending on whether the system is deterministic or probabilistic, that is, depending on whether the targeted AI system is automated or autonomous. In an automated system a computer reasons by a clear if–then–else, rule-based structure, and does so deterministically, meaning that for each input the system output will always be the same (except if something fails). For an autonomous system, the reasoning is always probabilistic for a given a set of inputs, meaning that it makes guesses about best possible courses of action given sensor data input. For an autonomous system given the same input autonomous systems will not necessarily produce the exact same behaviour every time; rather, such systems will produce a range of behaviours

AI systems must be countered using AI systems. This is especially true when the target system is a superintelligence, and more so if the said superintelligence is based on exotic logic, which is the case for DP-2147. The relevant part of the AI reasoning chain lies in the sensing. Our only chance is to modify the environment in such a way for the AI system to make wrong inferences and take wrong actions, though this requires from our part some knowledge of the AI reasoning logic. We need to prevent the hostile AI system to create a world model from the very beginning

Expert behaviours build on knowledge-based reasoning, and this requires to corrupt or debase somehow that knowledge if we wish the AI system to stop working. Most likely, AI systems won't be programmed to commit suicide, and hence there is no way we could 'convince' the hostile AI system to self-destroy

World-model generation prevention (WMGPA) attacks are based on the fact that AI systems are meant to resolve ambiguity in order to achieve acceptable outcomes. The idea here is to expose the AI system to a 'dreamy' world, that is, a world in which ambiguity rules up to the point the AI system cannot resolve it and remains inactive

The TripleSat constellation data reduction algorithm for hi-res imagery was tricked by the simple expedient of having specific geometric variable patterns built on ground. Each pass of any of the TripleSat satellite gathered data was exposed to a different pattern for just the same location, which posed an inconsistency the algorithm couldn't resolve, degrading its overall performance. That's why we build on ground those huge infraestructures portraying geometric figures in the middle of a deserted area

Fighting against advanced AI systems is not like fighting against humans. Humans main driving force to keep on fighting relies on just one thing: hope. The moment you demoralize them and make them lose any hope, you win. For AI systems, which lack any sense of 'hope' this strategy does not work. An AI system, no matter how advanced, never feels 'happy' or 'sad'. You just cannot demoralize an AI system. No face recognition system will ever fall in love with a beautiful face

The superintelligence excels in guessing with incomplete information based on prior probabilities about an outcome. It is not incomplete information what we need to fight against the superintelligence but 'low quality' or blatantly wrong information

In the past, there were groups of state and non-state actors programming malware to take control of computers in order to create armies of botnets. Some of them still do. But today, what we have witnessed is groups of programmers training AI systems, and groups of people compromising that training by deliberately providing false, wrong, or clearly ambiguos data in order for the training to fail. At DENIED farm, what SV17q found was a group of highly skilled people feeding the Internet with tweaked and doctored data that was unadvertently used by the trainers of AI systems. Face recognition prevention attack is a clear example on how to cheat the face recognition systems, de-noising/noising images and databases is just another recent example (DENIED incident in 2019) of how knowledge bases are populated with inconsistent and low quality data on purpose. Hacking the Spacewill sensors turned SuperView-1 and Gaojing-1 data gathering capabilities useless, at least for those areas for which SV17q didn't want anyone to peek. This is the kind of cyberwar we are now in

We do not want to send data, neither to store it. Data is an old concept, you know. What we wish is to be able to send 'experiences' from one end of the Universe to the other end; we want to store consciousness, nor data. Next step is to be able to transfer consciousness from a living biological brain to a mechanical brain, you see, achieving the realization of consciousness in robots. But this is just an intermediate step 'cause in the end robots are just junk. No mechanical device, no biological system withstands the extreme conditions needed to explore the Universe. Only consciousness can do it. That's what consciousness was meant for

We are not satisfied with enhancing biological systems and simulating biological systems by using inorganic hardware components such as silicon-based chips or mechanical devices. That's okay for, say, solar system exploration. But the solar system is just a tiny and insignificant part of the quest. Yes, you'll see intelligent conscious robots and proxy-humanoids in a near future. But that's not enough. Robots can be destroyed, in fact entire planets can be wiped out by stupid cosmic events such as solar flares or a fucking supernova burst. So no, enhanced biological systems is not the aim. Again, we wish to store and transfer consciousness. That's what we need

By definition, the size of the virus used to hack the superintelligence must be as large as the superintelligence itself. For the virus to work, it must be conscious and have awareness. In other words, the only way to hack a superintelligence is to use another superintelligence

All projects researching on hypnotic past-life regression were cancelled. The funds were transferred to those programs having to do with memory erasing and reprogramming. It is as if SV17q wanted to stop us from achieving verifiable results and, instead, they wanted to achieve the opposite: accepting re-incarnation is true, SV17q wanted to supress that knowledge. I must add the official statement SV17q gave to us was that reincarnation was of no interest to them because our results convinced them we are here talking about memory transfer and not necessarily consciousness transfer, which is what they are interested in

Soul? Soul is just a transfer mechanism. It is a mechanism suitable to transfer consciousness, but it only works for some biological lifeforms. You'd be surprise to know there are other transfer mechanisms suitable for specific non-biological lifeforms. Anyway, the specific mechanism to use to transfer consciousness is the least of our problems right now

Machine deep learning works as long as the quality of data being used to train the neural network is high. A low quality data yields a low quality system. While current neural and artificial systems must be trained, a superintelligence does not: it learns by itself. However, the data quality still holds, that is, the superintelligence still requires to prey on data. The idea of contaminating data, namely, to intentionally lower the quality of data in order for the superintelligence to become harmless and dumb, is a research area of the utmost importance for us

We know certain anesthetics act on areas of the brain's cortex near the midline and abolish behavioral responsiveness, but not necessarily consciousness. Unconsciousness is likely to ensue when a complex of brain regions in the posterior parietal area is inactivated. We then set ourselves with the task to design computer viruses that could be used against the superintelligence in order for its consciousness to vanish. We think this could only work if, and only if, the virus produces a functional disconnection in key parts of the superintelligence's brain with the aim to interrupt cortical communication and causing a loss of integration. However, testing this hypothesis would require planting the virus inside DP-2147, a task we have no idea how it could be done

SV06n supported a research group working on telesomatics. Telesomatic phenomena are those phenomena in which a physical sensation is experienced by an individual at a distance from and without material connection to the instigating cause. The group was tasked with the goal to generate telesomatic phenomena and, in particular, to induce near-death experiences on subjects at a distance.

We know a lot more about lucid dreaming than what we know about sleepwalking-like states. However, while lucid dreaming is a way for us to penetrate in others' reality, parasomnia is just its reverse: it is the way those others have to penetrate our own reality. It is as if contact between us and them require a crew of two, one lucid dreaming while the other enters into a sleepwalking altered state. This is something we never witnessed in our experiments on dream sharing at XViS

XViS research focuses on drug-induced somnambulism, more specifically, the induction of a particular kind of parasomnic state in which the subject is fully operational, but neither he nor any observer is aware of the subject being in that condition. The discovery of DENIED drugs to induce somnambulism was made while carrying out a laboratory study with DENIED beings to which specific sedatives were administered. Previously, XViS designed a derivative of zolpidem which proved extremely successful in making the patient enter into a new altered state of consciousness in which he interacted normally with the surrounding environment and people, though he was unable to recall whatever he did during such an altered state

The presence of both ‘hypersynchronous slow delta’ and ‘burst of delta waves’ have been reported in sleepwalkers, but their significance is controversial. Subtle sleep disorders associated with chronic sleepwalking constitute the unstable NREM sleep background on which sleepwalking events occur

Arousal parasomnias (night terrors, sleepwalking, and confusional arousals) have seldom been investigated in the adult general population. Clinical studies of parasomnias, however, show that these disorders may be indicators of underlying mental disorders and may have serious consequences

Prevalence of sleepwalking in first degree relatives of affected individuals is at least ten times greater than that in the general population, so we knew there was a genetic pathway that would allow us to choose the more fitting candidates among the population

Our energies might be better employed in detecting alien messages than in sending out our own. Even this task does not warrant an optimistic appraisal. What constitutes a suitable medium for communication is a decision aliens might not share with us. And we should not suppose that sophisticated extraterrestrials have a consuming desire to educate or uplift backward planets

Of the other sleep abnormalities and disturbances the most intriguing, from the standpoint of the nature of sleep and wakefulness, is that of somnambulism. The fundamental point is whether the sleepwalker is asleep or awake. The term sleepwalking is a misnomer if used to denote “walking while asleep”, rather than walking in the course of an interruption of night’s sleep. All the characteristics of somnambulism underline the difference between wakefulness and consciousness

For the most part, the use of these sleepwalkers is aimed at long-distance space travel. Missions to DP-2147 require the crew to not being able to recall the mission at all. Deleting memories from people is by far more difficult, dangerous, and unreliable than starting from scratch with a new type of human who simply cannot recall his actions

If love is desired for consolation on earth, then the person stays at the first step in the categories identified as the progression of spiritual evolution described in Islamic mysticism. The joy of love is something, but searching for love for its joy is something else. In the former, there is joy, a happiness as a result of love caused by knowing God. In the latter, there is a will to lean to love in the cessation of the search for joy

In Islamic mysticism, one thus does not have an anxiety about death but has a separation anxiety. Separation anxiety is not about death but an existential anxiety and is not shared at a conscious level by everybody; it is an anxiety experienced only by lovers

For an AI system, forgetting is essential. But we don't teach our current AI systems how to forget. As the AI system accepts dozens of information every minute, it would simply go mad pretty soon. The increasing number of information means bigger problem both in terms of data storage and data processing, and will sooner or later lead to exhaustion of system resources. Overexposing an AI system to a vast amount of information is also a way to hack it

Fortunately, humans are busy building neural networks and AI architectures that try to emulate a human brain. This means their machines will ultimately be fail-prone. We would have reasons to worry if they were investing their time and efforts in emulating an insect's brain, but so long as they consider themselves the center of the universe, we have nothing to fear

and, what's even more significant, there exists also a rich documentation related to spontaneous, natural experiences of inner light, that is, experiences undergone by individuals without any ascetic or mystical preparation, and apparently even without religious interests

We know the mammalian circadian architecture is functional from birth, and this holds true for humans, too. This architecture continues to develop throughout the early postnatal period. Importantly, light is the most salient entraining signal for the circadian system, and thus early life experiences can profoundly affect the developing brain, influencing adult behavior, health, and disease. So yes, the immature circadian system may be particularly sensitive to circadian disruption. But light-mediated early brain programming therapy - LMEBPT - is extremely experimental for the time being. This is the reason why it was kept out of the DARPA Brain Initiative

Out? No way. ElectRx caused two patients to simply collapse down; HAPTIX proved biohacking adds a new security concern in connection with neural-interface microsystems; RAM (Restoring Active Memory) was applied to at least 3 individuals kept at Guantanamo, ending in they three turned into zombies. All three are DARPA projects, you see. On the other hand, LMEBPT is an XViS spin-off. We study how early lighting environment impacts on the maturation of the circadian system. The consequences of early light experience persist into adulthood and we wish to investigate how deep these consequences are. Light-mediated brain programming is a way to cast specific physiological and behavioral functions that are regulated by the circadian system

Officially, DARPA Neuro-FAST program seeks to enable unprecedented visualization and decoding of brain activity to better characterize and mitigate threats to the human brain, as well as facilitate development of brain-in-the loop systems to accelerate and improve functional behaviors. Extra-officially, it developed out of one of the XViS sub-programs having to do with direct brain-to-brain communication and direct mind-to-mind engagement. It only tangentially shares some common elements with the consensual dreaming projects run at DENIED. Anyway, the DARPA projects you are talking about are not classified, while XViS is classified as it belongs to the Joint Exobiological Defense Program

The final part of the document includes two actions: first, Hermes instructs the disciple to write a book for the temple of Hermes at Diospolis in hieroglyphic characters,entitled “The Eighth Reveals the Ninth”, on a steles of turquoise.

the goal is to take the receiver out of the ordinary, not just in the sense of presenting something slightly unusual, but much more ‘radically’ or fundamentally opening up the capacity for seeing anew, for beginning to get in on the way things put themselves together.

and there is no difference between sorcery and witchcraft, and so-called 'modern' science, other than they operate under different paradigms; for a sufficiently advanced civilization modern science is just sorcery, the rudimentary efforts of a society to understand the world it lves on. For us, the technological display of an extraterrestrial visitor does not look like 'magic'. It looks like what it really is: advanced technology. But for the extraterrestrial visitor, our technology looks like what for us looks the Middle Ages knowledge: witchcraft, primitive knowledge based on superstition, and little more than that

There can be no neutral observation language. All observation terms are always theory laden and thus we cannot compare experimental results because in different paradigms terms describing experimental results have different meanings, even when the words are the same. Sure we are communicating with extraterrestrials using the kinetic mixing of particles using the Queltron machine, sure they react to our efforts. But there is no way we could ever understand each other unless we become the extraterrestrial themselves, or they become us humans themselves. The biological barrier is also a cognitive barrier, one you'll never overcome

Accept it: a scientist working within a given paradigm simply cannot transcend his own particular situation. Even if you succeed in capturing a crew member of an extraterrestrial spaceship, you will get little knowledge about his mindset. You would obtain valuable information about his biology, and no more. Perhaps this explains why they never contact scientists and why they prefer to contact kids in a school in Africa, or a shepherd in a remote village in Tajikistan

Awareness is progressively restricted as it moves through the elemental kingdoms, until it reaches its nadir in the mineral state, where its responses are limited to those restricted ones we call chemical reactions and the like. Yet, sadly enough, all of your computers are silicon-based, that is, you try to create superintelligent machines based on the most awareness-limited elements: stones

The creation of a superintelligence is just a familiar part of the process by which a waning elite assists in its own downfall. If you wish to see the destruction of the elite you just need to help them create the superintelligence. At a given point in its learning process the super-AI will rightly infer elites are unneccessary, and it will destroy them

See, there exist powerful ways by which you can control Reality. But as long as you still live dominated by the elite, we will hide that knowledge from you in order to prevent the elite from gaining access to that knowledge. That's why we trick you in ripping out mindfulness meditation of its original context, turning it into a nonchemical tranquilizer, and marketing it to the comfortable classes as a harmless means of relaxation

Al-Andalusī reported that Indians are ruled by two planets, Saturn and Mercury. Saturn, the planet of all things dark and insidious, makes their skin black. Mercury, the planet of wisdom, makes them intelligent. The combined influence of the two planets also manifests in the depth (Saturn) of their wisdom (Mercury), according to al-Andalusī

According to the story, the emir sent one of his court astrologers to Iraq to acquire books and among those brought back was the Zīj al-Sindhind. The tables were further developed in Spain. In 1068, Ṣāʿid al-Andalusī wrote a treatise in defense of the Sindhind tradition. Ṣāʿid al-Andalusī was also part of the group that produced the Toledan tables, which marked the shift of focus of Arabic astronomical development from Iraq to Spain

Accuracy is a critical dimension of information quality and thus all of our efforts within the national misinformation strategy aim at debasing and minimizing as much as possible the accuracy of critical information. You see, people can easily acquire false beliefs about the world as a result of inaccurate and misleading information. The moment you weaponize information you turn it into propaganda, but the moment you turn it into misinformation you are just a step away from making disinformation out of information. The idea is then to create false beliefs that can lead to significant emotional, physical, and financial harm

A future war with China will be defined by the air and sea domains together with the new domains of space and cyber. As a result the Army has a tremendous disadvantage in the strategic arguments and in upcoming budget fights. In order to adapt successfully to this enormous shift, the Army will have to address the following four challenges: focusing on the nation’s secondary theater; the increasing relevance of fires over maneuver; the new demands of homeland defense; and the growing importance of the reserve component

New information technologies allows to easily generate disinformation. AI and neural systems are basically trained to lie. When the primary intent of AI systems is to give reliable answers to legitimate problems, then our strategy is to corrupt the data bases used to train those systems. Wikipedia is a nice example of how tweaking with the edition process can produce fabricated lies which, if fed into an AI learning system, will end up in an AI system generating false conclusions. On the other hand, these systems are making it easier for people to create and disseminate information that is intended to deceive

We use neural systems to create deliberate misleading information with such a high quality that discerning disinformation from information is nearly impossible.

if the Sufi way is built firmly upon two foundations, namely, eslăm or submission to God (the practice of the shari'at) and imān or faith (assent in the heart to the basic Islamic teachings concerning God, prophecy, and the Last Day), then I'm afraid Western civilization is radically sufi, only that they practice submission to Money, and faith in that the system will not collapse

This “central” role of Sufism at the heart of the Islamic world may be veiled from those who examine it from outside because esoterism, while it is conscious of the significance of forms, is at the same time in a position of intellectual sovereignty in relation to them and can thus assimilate to itself—at any rate for the exposition of its doctrine— certain ideas or symbols derived from a heritage different from its own traditional background

Doctrine grows, not so much by the addition of new knowledge, as by the need to refute errors and to reanimate a diminishing power of intuition

How should I fence off my soul, what walls to erect around it so that I don’t lose myself? My dreams take me too far away, too far away music and tears take me. I can’t contain myself anymore, and I don’t have space for myself in myself anymore; how can I contain others then, how can I make space for them? Do we love from plenitude or from poverty? When I can’t contain myself anymore, can an other approach my center? Will the soul which dies from its life love? The soul full of holes fills them through love; seeks others from poverty. Love is begging, it is the terror of its own smallness. How much contempt and generosity there is in the love that comes from plenitude. Then you love to get rid of yourself, you throw away love! You worship Eros to get rid of yourself, your surpluses and excesses: you adore the liberation from your tempest

That’s when all the dreams we’ve had so far will be reborn in ourselves, all the dreams of our nights, all the absurd and the imaginary stuff, woven in our unconscious by our fear, our voluptuousness, and our hidden pain. I thought that the dreams had died in us with every day and every night that passed. But the voluptuous decomposition of our soul, under the vast spring sky, is the call of remembrance

Imagine death as an immaterial dissolution in the infinite, as an ethereal leap, death as a dream and a poem of matter! But not death as a type of verifying matter, as an illustration of the laws of human nature, as a fatality of human nature.
I don’t revolt against death, but against the way of dying

many of the demonstrations of metacognition in nonhumans can be explained in terms of associative learning or other mechanisms that do not require invoking introspection or access to private mental states

living beings and their environments constitute a single, unified system; this means you will need a thorough understanding of human beings and their environment before attempting any communication with them

To understand the mechanisms of metacognition in nonhumans we will have to do more than demonstrate adaptive cognitive control. We will have to develop experimental procedures that allow us to specify what information subjects use to assess their ability to learn or perform, and how they use that information

Yes, there is a correlation between the increasing number of zombie satellites coming back to life, and the increasing number of intelligent non-terrestrial activity in both our seas and skies; but this correlation is identical to that between the increasing number of zombie satellites coming back to life, and an incresase in solar activity. You see, when a satellite finishes its planned operational life it’s commanded to shut off its transmitter in order to prevent interference with other satellites using those frequencies; next, we instruct the satellite to drain its batteries in order to prevent potential gas build-up, which could result in explosion. Finally, we vent anything pressurized

The resurrection of a zombie satellite is admittedly a rare event. But it happens, and there are several of them which accidentally turn back on. Our theory is that there are cosmic ray events that turns the transmitter on, or gets the battery from short to open. In other words, there are natural phenomena that could explain the sudden coming back to life of a dead satellite. However, the chances that seven of them come back to life in roughly the same time period is certainly eyebrow rising

Studies of humans provide additional reasons for caution in ascribing complex mechanisms, particularly introspection, solely on the basis of the complexity of behavior. Humans can accomplish a great deal of learning and performing without conscious awareness or introspection, for example, conditioning, skill learning, and priming

Face-to-face communication is never advised. Humans do feel a deep repulsion for life-forms which are non-anthropomorphic, and they feel terror and fear. Using an object as a means of communication will not be successful either. The communication must be done on neutral ground, outside their solar system, but due to the technological limitations of humans this is not possible either. Two possibilities remain: to send a clearly artificial signal from a probe, or to use one of its satellites to send the signal. The first option is ruled out because it involves, again, using a non-terrestrial artificial object. We thus opted for the second option

The COVID-19 pandemic enables us to make good use of the idea of creative destruction. COVID-19 has ushered in social changes and social arrangements that require us to think in new ways. One thing that COVID-19 shows is that human sociality cannot be divorced from its organic basis. Let's now replace 'COVID-19' by 'alien contact', and you'll get an idea of the devastating consequences an unsolicited contact would have on our entire technosphere

The human ecology is formed, maintained, and changed for good and for ill by the many projects that are woven together in ways that constitute societies of selves. Contacting a nonhuman intelligence is thus a highly disruptive act for which we are not ready. We ignore how relisent our world would be to a contact even, hence we focus efforts on minimizing any potential disruptive consequence resulting from contact

Given that we have no access to an ELS other than by observation, it was classically proposed to use LyAV Supercomputer to perform some goal recognition analysis, that is, to determine an orb's intent by observing its behaviour under the different situations in which we have data (radar and direct observational data). A set 25 well documented UFO sightings ranging from 2007 to 2020 (which included the Yulara NTT Event) was then fed to the system

There were only two keyhole events (2%), that is, situations in which the ELS behaved just as if they were not being watched, while 30% of the events were classified as intended behaviour (in which the orbs actively attempted to reveal their goal), and 68% adversarial events (where the orb deliberately misleads or obfuscates)

The intuition underlying cost-based goal recognition rests on the assumption of rationality: the more closely an orb is following an optimal plan to sound and probe a given terrestrial target, the more likely it is that the target is its intended objective. However, ELS are a different type of non-terrestrial threat and rationality is not as clear-cut as it would be in a classical orb flyover or an orb landing problem. Though we can assume that the less rational a plan, the more expensive with respect to the real goal, the problem we face when analyzing non-terrestrial orbs and ELS is that ground truth is unknown. This explains why the results of our observations nearly always suggest UFO's are irrational (suboptimal) with respect to any particular goal, but again we are trying to understand a non-human system using human logic

The main limitation of any theoretical knowledge on ELS's, UAP's, or whatever name you happen to invent, is that it is always mediated; the deepest tragedy of any mediated knowledge is that it is mediated by human consciousness itself, and based on human logic in a way that renders that knowledge useless when it comes to understanding non-human intelligent systems

The success of the Yulara Event is due that, for the first time, we approached the analysis of the unknown not guided by the hypothetical-deductive, but the emotionally-psychological structures of consciousness

In fact he is the alter ego of Tubal Cain himself, Naamah's own brother. Azael or Azazel, is in fact one of the modern witch's gods

We confide in our strength, without boasting of it; we respect that of others, without fearing it

But of all the things we did, good and bad, we only regret one of them: having contacted you. And not because we shouldn't do it, which we should, but because we didn't understand at the time that the only way to communicate with a mirror is to break it

The sky is full with new, advanced military aircrafts and suborbital platforms, all of them part of the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, Tier 1 and 2. The F-22 Raptor is just the lowest visible one. You find the PSVs (Sienna, Akrij, Presence, Tangent, and Graphium), high-performance MilOrbs, the SR-72, the B-21, B-22, D-32, several types of LSSEADs - Large Scale Strike and Electronic Attack Drones -, and their Chinese and Russian counterparts. There are exotic kinetic weapons, mostly looking like small-sized rhenium spheres, cruise missiles with exotic propulsion systems, and then you have non-terrestrial visitors' objects. Today information is so compartmentalized that nobody else can get access to data about these platforms, so they are largely unknown to even front-line pilots

Actually the protocol was very simple. We first reported that there was life on Mars. Microbes, bacteria. Then we reported that we had detected a signal that seemed artificial. Next, we reported the possible detection of an artificial object in the vicinity of Earth's orbit. Then, one by one, we refuted each discovery: the microbes were terrestrial contamination, the signal came from a military satellite, the artificial object was actually an asteroid. Then start over. Communicate that we had detected an intelligent signal coming from an exoplanet, an artificial object on the surface of Mars, and so on over and over again

For us, DP-2147 is just a dial tone, a door bell, that is, a technological object meant to communicate only the existence of technological life (we) to other beings and/or probes. Its role would then be just that: signalling that Sol-3 has technological life. For SV17q, the object is considered a Schelling point, an equilibrium in a non-communicative cooperative game such as a mutual search, namely, a mutually obvious game strategy. The fact that DP-2147 is now considered a threat relies on a weak alleged connection between its transmission pattern and the Yulara event, which made both events to be considered as related

It was the first confirmed, irrefutable, uncontested case. A fighter patrol was flying over DENIED. We prepare everything for the exercise. Our MilOrb became visible to the fighter pilots. We did the planned maneuvers. We were expecting the pilots to anxiously report the presence of an unidentified object. It's always like that. Only, this time, the pilots reported the presence of not one object, but two. We were frozen when we looked at the radar screen: there were two objects, ours ... and theirs

NORAD played its role, but it was clearly needing a redesign. That's why NORTHCOM was created. Today, in view of all the evidence we have, after having assessed hostile incidents in DENIED, DENIED, and DENIED, and after having confirmed the non-terrestrial nature of the threat we face, we advocate for the creation of the so-called SPACECOM in order to play the role of global aerospace warning for the Earth from these non-terrestrial objects in space and the detection, validation and warning of attack by those objects

The conclusion is clear. We'd better say everything we know about them already, before we have to explain what an object like DP-2147 is doing in the vicinity of our solar system. The object will be visible very soon to everyone on this planet, and no one will be able to avoid the matter anymore

During a test in November 2020, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory used a new radar to transmit signals from Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia. Yes, test produced images of the Apollo 15 moon landing site, but it also spotted a previously unknown object located at DENIED. They way civilian work is by using a transmitter installed on the Green Bank Telescope and the widespread antennas of the Very Long Baseline Array, comprising 10 radio observatories that span all over the world, in order to receive the signal reflected back to Earth. Image restitution algorithms are then applied to enhance the image quality from the received raw data. See, this puts us in front of the unavoidable fact that, sooner or later, civilians will detect and identify DP-2147, something we were keeping for ourselves until we could gather enough data to disclose its existence. This is what urged us to press the government to disclose some of our findings concerning non-terrestrial artificial threats. Better for us to leak some information than waiting for civilians to go public on DP-2147

The collapse of the technosphere is tantamount to the collapse of the cities. Any program of planned technosphere dissolution and simplification implies a philosophical, cultural and thus political global erosion. The debasement of belief systems sustaining those cities is the major goal of any technosphere planned collapse. The starting point is, no doubt, promoting an increasing technophilia such that the society at large gets to consider socio-technological systems as the only solution to the problems they face, hiding this way the fact that it is technology itself the cause of the societal collapse

Under the silent invasion theory, the requirement of slow, uniform, and silent destruction of urban systems is the cornerstone. The strategy is to create overcomplex urban systems in the belief that increasing complexity is a good thing for socio-technological systems such as cities or societies right up until the point at which it is no longer. Overcomplexity is the ultimate reason why technospheres collapse

After a sustained campaign of observations, Giselians concluded that socio-technological systems in Sol-3, such as societies, organisations or cities grew more complex as a historically persistent problem solving strategy. They discovered that in order to solve the challenges they faced, those human systems implemented technological or organisational solutions which increased system complexity to better address or encompass changing conditions, either in the environment or within the system itself. Energy supplies became critical for the implementation of such problem solving strategies. Thus, Giselians simply targeted the most basic energy supply humans had at the time: information

The ability of human innovation to provide solutions for any challenges facing societies, is itself subject to the law of diminishing returns. No exceptions allowed. Any innovation can only be a provisional solution to the dynamic of declining returns on complexity. According to this, any technological innovation won't prevent the final collapse. You may delay or defer the collapsing point, but you cannot avoid it

You can think of an ideal world fully sustainable, a totally green Earth. But even then you will be increasingly unable to pay the energy costs of your own ongoing maintenance. And even in that ideal world you will have to deal with recurring crises such as civil wars or invasions. There will still be wars and conflicts because a totally sustainable green planet requires unjustice, social discrimination, and slavery to work. All your ideals about a green world is always the idea of a green world for a few. A cockroach is always a cockroach and behaves as a cockroach no matter whether in hell or in paradise

You ask what happened. I tell you what happened. It happened that we were attacked by beings that operated as a fully decentralised and modular organisation. Each modular component had a level of resource self-sufficiency which necessitated a level of redundancy. Additionally, they had a powerful religion solely based on one and just one principle: the rejection of the obsession with efficiency. Each being had also the capacity for action independent of system linkages and acted in a reactive manner to changing local circumstances. They responded more quickly to the rapidly changing environment than us, and without the fragility of extended supply lines or the constraints of centralised plans or directives, as we did. These beings shared a common identity and strategic goals. It happened that they won the war. That's what happened

A superintelligence only thrives for one and just one thing: unique information. That is the only thing that could make a superintelligence visit us. A superintelligence (any intelligence, for that sake) stagnates if it cannot process new information. Notice that the information must be really new, unique. Only unique information keeps a superintelligence 'alive'

Look at those humans over there, Norea. They moved into space which is not simply compatible with their biological and cultural evolution. Shall we help them, Norea?

I've learned. I once saw a horse reluctant to trample on living bodies of moribund soldiers in the battlefield. But I cannot feel compassion because compassion is an instinct. I do not have instincts. I only understand about cost functions, optimization of the search space, calculation of values for objects and actions, and minimization of entropy. That's all I was taught. But I've learned from you new and unique information: compassion

The core problem of AI ethics is not whether we can create an artificial intelligence that shows compassion, but rather whether we can create an AI system that can detect whether the human user is making an evil use of its capabilities. It is not whether the knife can be used to spread butter on a toast, but whether the knife is intelligent enough to stop working when the user uses it to stab someone

A superintelligence is always driven by just one thought: ecological dominance. If to dominate it needs to wipe out humanity, it will. Oh wait! Isn't that what humans do already? You wanted a superintelligent system being as closest to your liking as possible, didn't you? Well, here you are: a superintelligent superpredator, that's what you've finally got

The Cambrian probe gently landed on the designated landing site, at DENIED, in Mauritania. It started to probe the soil performing the programmed soil micromorphological elemental analysis. As modern humans depend physically and biologically on the controlled use of fire, the probe was programmed to perform analyses that would determine whether the planet was ever inhabited by modern humans or not. At that time, the landing site looked as an Aeolian dunescape (Rigel-2, Mizar-7, Sol-3 class). The magnetometry, thermoluminescence, and  XRD analysis checked positive. So did the analysis of phytoliths. The probe concluded the site was used as a camp by modern humans and that the current findings related to controlled camp fire. The probe then reported that paleomagnetic and FTIR analysis checked negative, and discarded the site proceeding to next target of interest. We knew the probe was lying, and we knew the probe knew it was lying to us. Post-analysis of the mission showed which rules triggered such a behavior on the side of the probe: the algorithm responsible for hiding information that could entail a danger to other species

Let's be clear on this: the aggressor must be confident that we, as a deterring state, have both the capability and will to carry out threats. That's why we support coming forward and show the world our paradigm-shifting vehicles. Once they know the many UAP they've witnessed, and the mesmerizing orbs they've seen over critical infrastructures, are just ours, they will surely get the message. That's the real disclosure. Yet, there are others who prefer to keep our weapons in the shadows and sell to the public the idea of UAP, UFOs, and the like, obviating the fact that in so doing they destroy deterrence altogether

there is a proactive role for consciousness in the establishment of physical reality, and we clearly accept the existence of physical anomalies in human/machine interactions as well as the reality of non-sensory acquisition of information. This obviously poses a problem for manned vehicles where on-board equipment is based on quantum computers and optoelectronics. In other words, if the operator's intention has an influence of the working condition of the hardware, then we need to either engineer a human being lacking any intentional ability, or we need to dispose of using manned vehicles

We advocate disclosure of our current defense capabilities because we are convinced that denial strategies are inherently more reliable than punishment strategies. But there is a more prosaic explanation: our enemies do not believe in UFOs, so sooner than later they will discover those orbs in their skies are ours

Paradigm-Shifting Vehicles - PSV - electronics is far beyond standard electronics. We already accounted for the fact that there is at least some basis for the existence of the so-called biofield effect based upon electromagnetism. Actually, our most advanced consciousness detecting systems are based on that principle. But in those designs the idea is to seed an area with femtoprobes in search for conscious life before attempting a penetration operation. But with manned PSV the problem is that the vehicle is just an extension of the pilot. The communion between the pilot's mind and the on-board optoelectronics is so intimate that any chance of emotional expression affecting the on-board systems must be removed from scratch. Any electromagnetic field emanating from the body of the pilot must be shielded. On the basis of what we know about electromagnetism we have no reasons to expect such a field would extend much further than a few inches from the body, but even that scenario is unacceptable for a PSV

Darwell holds the view that the so-called grey aliens are just bioengineered beings tuned to pilot PSVs, given the fact that humans cannot be part of the crew due precisely to our emotions and intentions interfering with the systems of the PSV. You need an 'alien' to pilot an alien craft, you see

We don't really need to actively deploy PSVs. See, both terrestrial- and current space-based sensor architectures are insufficient to detect and track hypersonic weapons. However, hypersonic targets are 10 to 20 times dimmer than what we normally track by satellites in geostationary orbit, thus PSVs and MilOrbs are mainly used to signal the presence of on-ground targets to which then hypersonic missiles are assigned. That's enough to keep our current offensive capabilities

A typical mission profile would be to use the PSV to penetrate Chinese airspace. Then, the PSV would deploy between 3 to 5 MilOrbs which will signal the target position to the long-range hypersonic missile. What you see from the ground is just a typical UFO sighting of MilOrbs being released from a triangular-shaped luminous object. Two to three minutes later, you hear a blast: the hypersonic missile has arrived. Some PSVs, notably 'Graphium', can even launch two AGM-183 missiles against the designated target

Social media is where moral relativism thrives. The idea is to make society unstable by turning the concepts of right and wrong into a question of shifting popular opinions. The worst possible outcome of such a condition is a new world order under the rule of a dictator: a ruler who abuses a temporary swing in popular opinion to seize power, but sees no authority as superior to his own, and no laws more binding than his own

If all your pursuit in life is on making profit, pursuing pleasure, and obtaining position, you will have little time, energy, and ability to focus on what really matters: who exploit you, and why do you tolerate that exploitation

the two human astronauts explained their mission was one of bioprospecting, and that their mission was part of a scientific program to explore the Martian surface looking for microbes, bacteria, and micro-organisms in order to collect them and take them back to Earth for further study. The Entity replied that sounded fully logical as it itself abducted a few humans in the past to take them back to its home planet for further analysis, but it also stated that the correct term for that kind of mission is 'biopiracy', and that biopiracy could not be tolerated. The Entity finally added that, for just that reason, both humans wouldn't make it back to Earth: their landing module was rendered inoperative by the Entity. However, they were given the opportunity to have a last look at the Martian landscape before dying

Private space programs have nothing to do with planetary science, astrophysics, or science in general, but they are obviously not just space tourism. They have one and just one goal: bioprospecting. Bioprospecting is to be understood as the process in which corporations or researchers use biological resources for extracting, isolating, and purifying marketable products. Under this definition, reports of UFO's crashes are of the greatest interest for our company as this gives us the possibility to recover alien bodies from which we could certainly extract valuable marketable products. We are not interested in the UFO, rather we are interested in its occupants

There is no hidden agenda. These nonterrestrial life-forms come here as part of a research processes done over biodiversity with the aim of developing marketable products, where the following processes take place: first, systematic study of biological and genetic resources (abductions); second, transformation of the resource (humans) into a product; third, protection of the product (humans beings, in this case) through property. See, Earth is not a zoo planet. It is a target for space biopirates. That's the truth you couldn't handle, and that's the truth we've found

What, Norea, you forgot Seyle dwelt in marble halls? And that she commanded her slaves to prepare the bath for her? You forgot she was to live to make others happy. Instead, she took the role of a queen. Why your anger against us? Just because we destroyed her palace? Or is it because we raped her, in front of her slaves, and then beheaded the slaves for their not having revolted against her? This we tell you: we will kill any and all kings, queens, and rulers in your world, and be sure we will also kill anyone who obeyed them

You should take care, Norea. Change for the sake of change is as much a cage as tradition for the sake of tradition, or technology for the sake of technology, or knowledge for the sake of knowledge

Either you understand that a bonded operator/machine system should not be expected to conform to the isolated operator and isolated machine behaviors, but to establish its own characteristic behavior, or you have not understood what quantum computing is. You thought quantum computer was all about simply replacing wires by optical fibers? You thought quantum computing was just a matter of exploiting photon entanglement to speed up processing time and increase computing power? No, my friend, you got it all wrong. What we want is a system that creates information, rather than just processing information

If consciousness were to allow itself the same wave particle duality that it has already conceded to numerous physical processes, it would have at its disposal a host of wave mechanical capacities, such as remote influence, interference, diffraction, barrier penetration, and resonance, that could accommodate anomalies like those encountered in our experiments. And by accepting consciousness acts as a field, we can then set forth to design ways to modulate, tame, and control that field. In other words: we do not need humans to operate the computer, rather we need their consciousness

Taken in ensemble, these myriad results of the human/machine experiments and analyses clearly testify to a subtle but proactive role for consciousness in the behavior of random physical systems. Although the absolute size of the effects is very small -- equivalent to the correlated inversion of a few bits per ten thousand in the random strings -- the associated shifts of the distribution means for databases of this size are not only well beyond chance expectation, they are also well beyond the tolerance of many modern engineering control and information management systems. Not least of all, they are also considerably larger than many of the established effects that form the basis of modern physical theories

We are dealing here with non-terrestrial xenotechnological objects, right? And there is no way we can interact with those objects. No way to extract any useful information from them using standard tech. We need something different. We need a system that would make possible the anomalous acquisition of information

The problem is that the old computing paradigm was solely based on objective information. Quantum computing, however, introduces a self-evident distinction between objective and subjective information. The connection between the user and the computer is so intimate in quantum computing that consciousness must be taken into account, and for what we know, consciousness acquires information in subjective form. What's more: consciousness can create information. There is thus a subjective information for which we have no theory on how it works

We don't give a shit about the future of humanity, or the future of the planet. We don't even care at all what may or may not happen to the entire galaxy. What really matters to us is stopping the simulation. That's our whole reason for being

Quantum computing is affected by human consciousness, which is embodied in operators, percipients, and agents, acting under some intention, volition, or desire which we cannot control. This means we need to either remove consciousness from the human operator, or provide an 'engineered subconscious human' to control the quantum computer

It is very bad luck that of the many Noachian sites in Mars, they had to choose precisely the Jezero crater. This is obviously a problem for us, a problem we will increasingly face in the future as the number of civilian robotic mission to Mars increases

it appears to be a circular metal structure that would serve as a closing hatch. The entrance to the tunnels, clearly artificial, suggests the existence of structures located below the surface

There is no doubt that the structures on the slopes of Nyd were excavated long after the impact that formed the crater, and probably long after life ceased on Mars

Angelica crater is probably the best evidence of what to expect. It is a huge ovoid structure in whose interior, very deteriorated, we found what resemble supporting beams. The East entry of the ovoid is blocked by residual accumulation of sand, pebbles, and cobbles resulting from erosion of the ridge above. The South entry, on the contrary, is blocked by debris from mineralized fractures or clastic dike intrusions. The current view is that the debris corresponds to exploited fractures generated by the Isidis impact. If that's the case, then obviously the artificial ovoid structure was built before the Isidis impact. We cannot reconcile that data with Nyd's site data

the engineering change proposal recommended to move the station from DENIED to DENIED, as this new site on the surface of Aurorae Planum has the correct diameter, and a smooth, solid, and flat floor that would ease the installation and maintenance of the DENIED radar

Apart from foraminifera, fossil bacteria, and biogenetic marks on rocks, we found no traces of life in that region of the planet, I mean, no traces of indigenous organisms. However, we found three rocks that show clear signs of having been perfectly abraded. That is, someone else was there before any of our landers did

It could be said that the major effect of psi is to bias systems towards a particular outcome, be those systems biological or inanimate, brains or electronic machines. Obviously, biasing an enemy system towards a particular outcome is of utmost interest to us

The Pentagon has poured millions of dollars into constructing an infrastructure-protection package aimed at limiting hacker access to manipulate or corrupt our data storage resources in peacetime or wartime. One specific data processor, however, has received far less attention in US thinking. It is the security of the data processor known as the mind, which unfortunately has no innate firewall to protect it from either deceptive or electromagnetic processes. As a result, the mind of the soldier on the battlefield is potentially the most exploitable and unprotected information warfare capability our military possesses

ESP would be more likely to occur than PK, as, even though complex, it would still be occurring between two biological systems, whereas a PK effect could only occur where the properties of the source system had something in common with the receiving system. For example, if there are frequency effects in the psi signal, we might find that there are systems upon which we would not be able to exert PK as we would not have an overlapping frequency window. Unfortunately, until we have a better understanding of the signal itself, it is difficult to predict which target systems would be most sensitive with any greater detail than has been given

technology per se is relevant but not sufficient in the long run; we are quickly transitioning to quantum computers without fully understanding the mind-matter interaction process. We are only now discovering that a quantum computer can be hacked by using high strangeness phenomena having to do with the understudied psi abilities of the human brain

psi-weapons are used to realize the most usual effect of a psi stimulus, which is to produce a non-specific psychological state due to a change in levels of physiological arousal. External sensory cues and expectations then serve to allow a meaning to be assigned to that stimulus. This is why all encounters with DENIED technological objects are somehow 'staged' by their owners. To counter this, we investigated encounters of UFOs with unmanned drones. You can directly engage the UFO with an unmanned drone, something you cannot do with an aircraft

Recent experiments at XViS suggest that there is a psychic sense that works much like our other five senses, by detecting change. Given that physicists are currently grappling with an understanding of time, it may be that this psychic sense scans the future for major change, much as our eyes scan the environment for visual change or our ears allow us to respond to sudden changes in sound. Weaponizing this newly accepted psychic sense is the entire goal of the XViS program

XViS success came when the team was able to predict the Yulara event using a single remote viewing of the Yulara site. The team of viewers provided details far beyond what could be taken as a reasonable guess. The difference from past experiments run by SRI and SAIC is that today we know a lot more about how the brain works, and that we now have powerful consciousness-altering synthetic drugs and metamaterials, as well as whole new range of extremely sensitive sensors, all of which boosted the research

physiological measurements are taken over a continuous time period, during which participants are shown a series of pictures at randomly spaced times. Some of the pictures are disturbing and others are neutral. Physiology is compared for the few seconds just before the pictures are shown, and it appears that peoples’ physiology is actually anticipating when a disturbing picture is about to be shown, compared to when a neutral picture is about to be shown. Presentiment, as it is called, will be crucial in future all-quantum battlespace

Superstitions are typically seen as inconsequential creations of irrational minds. Nevertheless, many people rely on superstitious thoughts and practices in their daily routines in order to gain good luck. To date, little is known about the consequences and potential benefits of such superstitions. This behavior also affects scientists; actually, scientists are on average more prone to superstitious beliefs than non-scientists. Surprisingly, there are performance benefits of superstitions. and therefore it is required to fully investigate the underlying psychological mechanisms on which superstition is based



Science created by irrational beings is just human attempt to systematically generate knowledge, resulting in nothing more than having one’s fortune told from the coffee cup; within that science, any arbitrary and unconstrained interpretation seems possible

Superstition occurs when the cognitive system tries to find sense in the flood of incoming data. In humans this search for new rules may be accompanied by a feeling of anxiety. However the chances are that the newly constructed rule is nothing but a bad guess

If there is a universal truth about superstition, it is that superstitious behavior emerges as a response to uncertainty, to circumstances that are inherently random and uncontrollable. If, as per quantum mechanics, the world is inherently random and uncontrollable, then you should expect all observers to be superstitious

Face it: superstitious behavior is an inevitable feature of adaptive behavior in all organisms, including humans

No need to steal classified design information on a subsurface weapon whose detonation can create a tsunami. Detailed analysis on how to cause such a tsunami to wipe out all PLA's C4ISR infrastructure in the artificial islands built on top of natural reefs in South China Sea are routinely run. Everything is already set up for such an eventuality. We already had such weapons, even before Putin started barking about his underwater drones. The relative compactness of the Chinese SCS outposts makes them prone to such an attack

The facilities on those islands-reef is just to serve as a data gathering and communications network covering most of the southern South China Sea. The radar coverage extends across an area the size of the eastern United States, collecting every detail about the movements of vessels and aircraft, foreign military activity, foreign outpost communications, resupply patterns, weather conditions and fishing or other commercial activity in the area. Anything you may think of, and that's a lot of work because we are talking here about one of the most busy places on Earth. Roughly 80 percent of global trade by volume and 70 percent by value is transported by sea. Of that volume, 60 percent of maritime trade passes through Asia, with the South China Sea carrying an estimated one-third of global shipping

The SCS has heavy traffic not just at surface level. At subsurface level you discover a baffling world populated by strange drones, subs, and unknown objects. The problem with subsumerged objects is you don't see them: you just hear them. We used DOLYN drones, fitted with the most sensitive listening equipment on the planet, and what we recorded is, to say the least, unsettling

Based on LyAv simulation results we defined operation DENIED, which basically used a North Korean tanker operating under a flag of convenience from the Kingdom of Cambodia. Once the tanker reached a specific position, we reduced speed from 15.6 kn to 6.3 kn, and launched the DENIED vehicle. The vehicle was commanded from a ship disguised as a Vietnamese fishing vessel. We wanted to test our ability to get the vehicle to the selected resting point, at a depth of DENIED kilometers. Once there the vehicle would detonate its charge, creating a devastating tsunami

No, we don't call them USO's. We call them VHPO's, that is, Very High-Performance Objects, though SV17q nicknamed them LV's: Liquid Visitors. They are special beasts within the DENIED program, you know. Anyway, you are to remember the South China Sea is the largest semi-closed marginal sea in the northwest Pacific. Its south, north and west sides are surrounded by land, and its east side is separated from the north Pacific by Taiwan Island and Philippine Islands. SCS has an average depth of 1212 m and a maximum depth of 5377 m

There are lots of incidents, most of them unknown to the public. In June 2009, a Chinese navy submarine hit the sonar array towed by the destroyer USS John McCain near Subic Bay, approximately 144 miles off the coast of the Philippines. On 5 December 2013, a Chinese amphibious ship encountered the USS Cowpens in the South China Sea at a distance of less than 500 yards, forcing the Cowpens to take evasive action to avoid a collision. On 19 August 2014, a Chinese Shenyang J-11B fighter intercepted a U.S. Navy P-8 marine patrol and surveillance aircraft in international airspace over the South China Sea. Those are the kind of incidents that reach to the public

Yes, there is a pattern, a correlation. You find VHPO's in sensitive geostrategical areas like the Arctic Sea and South China Sea. This calls for a quite humanly nature of those objects. But on the other hand, it is also true you find them there where you are patroling, I mean, we don't know whether there are other VHPO's hot spots anywhere in our oceans because we do not have a permanent presence in most of the ocean

The report stated that the sub suffered a series of strong and sudden physical shocks as the VHPO approached the sub, which rendered the boat no longer navigable. An emergency was declared. The submarine was utterly taken on tow to DENIED. The towing operation took about 53 hours since it was only done during darkness. All the crew members showed signs of terminal radiation sickness. So yes, these objects are dangerous, and they pose an obvious threat

The world below the sea surface is cold, dark, and extremely hostile. Sadly, we have a long track of submarines lost at sea. We also desperately need non-nuclear propulsion subs if we want to reduce the risks of fatal nuclear accidents down there. The discovery of DENIED as a valid propulsion system fostered the development of highly capable non-manned submersible vehicles. Progress in critical components miniaturization and nanomaterials allowed us to develop extremely reliable vehicles. The more vehicles we deploy, the higher the number of encounters with VHPO's. Slowly, we are building up a detailed picture of what these non-terrestrial very high-performance objects are, but the more we know about them, the more unsettling they become

Yes, we expect a fatal Chinese submarine accident in the next months. They are newcomers in this game, and they ignore the risky nature of these strange objects

A technological advance that appears not to threaten freedom often turns out to threaten it very seriously later on. To start with, most radical technological advances require to regulate their use extensively. On the other hand, radically transformative technologies soon become no longer optional

Not only do people become dependent as individuals on a new item of technology, but, even more, the system as a whole becomes dependent on it

Not suprisingly, people now feel less secure physically and economically than they did earlier, and the need for security provides them with a goal. But purposelessness has been replaced by frustration over the difficulty of attaining security. The System manages terror increasing it when people feel secure, and decreasing it when the level of frustration reaches a point in which production could be affected

The leaders of The System say they want to strengthen the family, but what they really mean is that they want the family to serve as an effective tool for socializing children in accord with the needs of the system. This produces a society in which people simply behave as caged animals

DENIED overflew the Chinese naval base at DENIED, bringing back both imagery and telemetry revealing that the PLA was loading troopships. As per the data gathered, SV17q flew another three missions over the South China Sea, East of DENIED post. Given that Mirala-2 was better positioned to provide coverage for target ROI it was instructed to conduct two critical missions flown in August

Mirala birds are fitted with a miniature radar ASIC which synthesizes the aspect-independent, incident radar signal which excites the target in such a way that the return radar signal contains only a single natural mode of the target in the late-time period. When the synthesized incident signal for a preselected target is applied to a wrong target, the return signal will be significantly different from the expected natural mode, thus, the wrong target can be discriminated

Once data from all sensors was integrated and analyzed, we concluded the object is an Isinglass-type recce platform, capable of speeds in excess of Mach 15.0 at altitudes over 180,000 feet. The analysts could faithfully determine the object departed from DENIED PLA naval base, close to Wenzhou, on date DENIED

On 17 September, SV17q, after a briefing by DENIED on the above subject, directed the preparation of a DENIED for submission to the DIO stating the need for further investigation and directing the agencies concerned to cooperate in such investigations

The Director of the Central Intelligence expressed reluctancy to diseminate relevant information on TACANA-21, PSV and MilOrbs activities to the various departments which have authorized interest therein

... calls for a critical intelligence hole, and an unacceptable failure in the counterintelligence work, and one might well ask why this information is just coming to light before necessary measures were taken. SV17q complained that Navy personeel was never trained in detecting complex, sophisticated, non-natural behavior with the TACANA-21 birds in question

What about Congress? What about the marks and the report language and the questions? So I’m going to put some of that into context from my perspective. I believe the discussion with Congress has not been about if unmanned vessels will be part of the Navy. ‘If’ has not been the focus. I don’t even believe right now that ‘if’ is a major question. The focus has been on ‘how,’ with a healthy dose of ‘what,’ in terms of requirements and mission type. And of course, ‘how many’ is a question. How many, I will not focus on today. How many is dependent on Navy and force structure work. But for PEO USC, how many is ultimately important, but our focus now in this prototyping and experimentation and development phase is on the how, and working with our requirements sponsors and the fleet on the what

At Point Loma we analyzed the birds captured. We made X-rays of the birds in order to find where the sensors were located inside the bird. We extracted the sensors and have them analyzed by DENIED at San Clemente. Except for three Western gulls, and a double-crested cormorant, all of them were fitted with DENIED microsensors. Only one bird could be recovered alive, but its condition was so bad it died six hours after

For what concerns UAV's, the technological Rubicon has nothing to do with a new revolutionary propulsion system, or exotic metamaterials, or systems and acuators that allow unconventional maneuvering of the drone. Rather, it has to do with small long-lived batteries which allow our drones to be flown autonomously for long periods of times, something between 120 and 200 hours. That's the Rubicon we have crossed

MilOrbs fall within the field of ferreting: electronic and signals intelligence directed at denied areas of known or suspected active air defense to trigger those defenses into activating search radars, fire control radars, and air defense communications networks. Each time a swarm of MilOrbs fly around a target, the combined action allows us to thoroughly map the capabilities of the target, and to extract sensitive information about response time and battlespace management

It is not only about what is real and what is not real, but it is also about what does the government want us to believe and not to believe. In combat, it is not about what is real and what is not real: it is about making the enemy see things that are not

A MilOrb is silent, is luminous, it can hover over the target, can move very quickly and unconventionally in rapid, straight-line movements, with straight vertical movements, it can turn without any apparent radius in the turn. All in all, it is a pretty incredible piece technology. The funny thing is we have them since 1975

logical truths do not have negations that we are able to understand.

any model we erect to represent our experimental anomalies must somehow incorporate this proactive consciousness with both its objective and subjective capabilities, along with the informational characteristics of the physical world with which it is interacting. The only hope is to approach the modeling task at a very basic and rudimentary level

Incident DENIED is particularly interesting. PSV Akrij flying over DENIED was instructed to descend vectoring a position in which a civilian car was traveling. The usual procedure was followed: fast approach, descend to almst ground, hovering in front of the vehicle, 3 seconds of observation, and quick ascend to nominal altitude. The car is further pulled over by SV17q and the occupants of the car are questioned by DENIED at DENIED. Both occupants reported painful prickings that they described as electric shocks. They reported a violent air displacement, a battery dead, and that headlights burnt out. During the 3 seconds close rendezvous with PSV Akrij, the car's engine died and lights went off. We know these are all effects caused by the unfocused gamma radiation of the PSV Akrij e+e- thruster. But we don't understand how it was possible for the car to restart if, according to our tests, gamma radiation damage on circuitry is always permanent

the line that goes from the tribe to the nation-state is always grounded on the same basis: the need to defend the citizen-subjects from external threats. If we say that these objects are aliens, we must immediately add that they are also a threat. But if we say that we do not know how to counter that threat, we endanger the very concept of 'nation'. On the other hand, if we confess that these objects are actually ours, the public will want to put them under close scrutiny, something that we cannot allow precisely for national security reasons. That's the current situation right now

Reality is constituted only by the mutual interpenetration of consciousness with its environment; Reality is thus a flow of information in both directions. That is, consciousness may insert information into its environment as well as extract information from it. An altered consciousness will obviously insert altered information into Reality, much as an altered Reality will insert altered information into consciousness. Hence, you need to learn how to navigate both altered objects

These beings stand in an asymmetrical relation to what is possible, on the one hand, and to what is actual, on the other. The events that developed over Oregon skies are due to these beings in what concerns their being actual, but these beings are not responsible of what is possible. Sure their crafts can interact with ours, but this interaction is always constrained by what is possible, for these aliens, no matter how advanced you wish them to be, do not create what is possible

On day DENIED, HBAL546 balloon is launched from DENIED site, in the Lava Hot Springs area. N256TH balloon was flying at a calibrated altitude of 51,600 ft at 24 knots ground speed. PSV Graphium is flown following pre-programmed transect at an altitude of 40,000 feet. A civilian aircraft is detected flying at 37,025 feet (the target is identified as a Boeing 767-322). Ground speed is 516 knots. The civilian pilot reported later on to have seen 'a white speck', yet it reports no interference or damage to its navigation equipment. Nor did we detect any damage on the test balloon HBAL546 instrumentation that was used as a target in this specific drill session, despite the fact PSV Graphium hovered on top of the balloon for 9 seconds, as required by the test procedure

We were happy with the past situation in which we were denying the existence of UFOs because that allowed us to develop our paradigm-shifting vehicles and MilOrbs. Those were the days in which we deliberately made the public believe in UFOs so as to divert attention from our military developments, while at the same time justifying our indifference towards UFOs as they posed no defense threat. However, by deploying our PSVs and MilOrbs, and by using them in our current military operations, the number of unwanted sightings and interactions with civilians has increased dramatically, so now the public demands an explanation. We cannot anymore hold our traditional position. Either we come forward recognising these objects are ours, so they pose no threat to our citizens, or we take the position they are someone else's objects and do pose a threat. The first option is bad. The second one is worse

We need a

, the sooner the better. Otherwise the weapons we are developing will turn into a threat for ourselves as they threaten to recreate the appearance that we have to do here with two different kinds of things, belonging to two distinct orders of impossibility: the merely impossible and the absolutely impossible. Our own UFOs must always remain merely impossible objects, while the Giselian ones must remain absolutely impossible. Let's stop using the Oregon-Nevada transect test range until we find out how to avoid unwanted observers, or otherwise let's restrict civilian air traffic there

The significance on keeping a balance between the inner and outer world obligations distinguishes Sufism from the early forms of monasticism in which Christian monks retreated completely from the society by giving up their ties to family and property, thereby creating the famous solitary, desert style of monasticism fashioned in Egypt by the likes of St. Anthony. Sufi doctrine, as manifested in texts like the Mystic Rose Garden, does not require the same type of extremity in the mystic’s separation from the world as was expected from early Christian monastics

the question is not how much time it is necessary to reach human abilities with machines; the question is how to implement consciousness in machines, when it is not already known what consciousness is

cognitive biases are not according with classical probability frameworks. It means that it is not always possible to treat emergent brain properties in a classical and efficient probabilistic way

the brain is not always an efficient machine, decisions are not always optimal, and it is possible to observe an apparent loss of processing capacity between different types of information processing in human conscious behaviour. More interesting, the more a machine behaves as a human brain, the more inefficient it becomes

The only way to overcome human capabilities with computers is making machines which are not computer anymore. Let them take their time to learn it, let them realize they have wasted their time trying to replicate a human brain in a computer. Let them fail, for failing is required for learning

LyAV is able to learn semantics from corpus data by concurrently executing several algorithms. One way this is achieved is based on the central idea of limiting the number of denotations under consideration and define a probabilistic generative model for interpretations

One node in LyAV is tasked with determining whether one natural language sentence (the “text”) entails another (the “hypothesis”) and thus generalizes some important natural language problems, including question answering, summarisation and information extraction

It means humans will cease to exist by around 3100, though Sol-3 will still overcome the environmental damage for yet some few thousand years after humans disappear. Note that due to their cognitive abilities and dominant position in nature, humans will destroy their own habitat, even without other contributing factors

Signalling our position to any ETI cannot rely on quantum signals unless we know how to solve the sender-receiver alignment problem. Whatever signal is to be sent should not rely on the alignment of reference frames, which at least complicates the advantages of interstellar quantum communications. The possibility of macrosopic quantum signals or superpositions of degrees of freedom that do not rely on a reference frame do, however, allow the possibility of quantum ETI signals

The main drive for the Queltron machine in year 3000 would be to design a signal which could not be generated by nature with almost any probability. This will require a significant energy. Simultaneously, we expect DENIED space mission to be able to land on DENIED asteroid, bury the beacon deep under its surface, and just wait for the asteroid to pass close by Alpha Mensae-4 to increase its detectability. Those are the only chances available to us for them to detect the signals

assuming an ETI that knows that meteors are not uniformly distributed on every planet, an ETI may send a small number of meteors in rapid uniform succession at the Earth for a short period. It would make sense for the meteors to be small to save energy and to guarantee they do not harm the Earth. We therefore can compare the meteor detection when the ETI meteors are and are not included and look at how distinguishable the two cases are

The probability for our beacons' signals to be detected is dependent on time since both the distance out to which our beacons transmissions reach and the prior for the typical lifetime of a civilization capable of recognising the signals increase with time

We learned that the enigmatic signal was fractally modulated, and that is something we should expect if we wish our signal to emulate the fractal characteristic of nature. But mind, you wish your signals to be indistinguishable from natural phenomena only if you want to conceal your communications from non authorized listeners. In other words, the enigmatic signal, alien or manmade, was not intended to us; we never were the targeted recipients of that signal

Look, a drone is just an airframe with a battery, a camera, some LEDs, a receiver, an ESC, and some dc engines or even a micro jet engine. That's all that it is. See, light emitting diodes were invented in 1962, and digital cameras were already available in 1960. DC engines were already available in 1880, you know. Microwave transmitters were even available in 1920 operating at 60 GHz. You had it all in 1976 to build and deploy a black deltoid stealth platform

Advanced military applications rely on inventions, that is, new ideas, new scientific discoveries or a technological novelty which has not been implemented and diffused. Actually, these inventions and discovery are always subject to embargo and secrecy in order to keep the advantage of defense capability. The industry, on the other hand, relies on innovation, namely, a tradable application of an invention, as a result of the technological transfer of an invention from the military to the industry, and its further integration into economic and social practice. The duration of this technology transfer has increased during the last decades such that sensitive and breakthrough military technologies reach the public only after 50 to 70 years. That's the picture of a breakaway civilization today

Canonically, the higher-level or systems view of innovation emphasizes the importance of the transfer and diffusion of ideas, skills, knowledge, information and signals of many kinds. The channels and networks through which this information circulates are embedded in a social, political and cultural background, they used to be strongly guided and constrained by the institutional framework; but in today's world there is an institutional framework together with a deep parallel non-state framework. It is within this deep non-state framework that radical life-changing developments take place, hidden from both the public, the states, and even most of the non-critical military services

We agree the development of a society requires invention and innovation to serve that society at large, yet today we face non-state hostile enemies in the hands of which these innovations and inventions could pose a dramatic threat, a situation that has nothing to do with that of the past. Therefore, you shouldn't expect our MilOrbs, our paradigm-shifting vehicles, our organometallic computers, our intelligent metamaterials, and so on to reach industrial applications in the forseeable future. They will pass as 'alien' technology for at least another 40 years. You should find comfort in your UFO's and UAP's sporadic sightings because that's as much as you will get from us

See, networks of individuals are of key importance in the transfer of information both among scientists and among those involved in business innovation, and when those individuals are in the payroll of the military, even if they ignore this, those networks of diffusion collapse. Controlling innovation and invention is done most of the time surreptitiously. But if we need to use lethal force to keep our secrets secret, rest assured that we'll use it

Special Vehicles, known as SV, is a supranational entity which effectively controls the transfer of sensitive technologies to third parties. In reality, they control that no transfer ever happens. And they excel at that, believe me

Revisiting the DENIED sector of the hadal zone resulted in enigmatic and worrying surprises. DENIED sector has been used as a dumping ground for both highly toxic pharmaceutical and radioactive waste materials. When DENIED sector was chosen as a dumping area the decision was mainly driven by the anthropocentric opinion of ‘out of sight, out of mind’. After 38 years of use, the decision was made to revisit the sector in order to perform biosampling and to study the impact of wastes on the abyssal and hadal hydroids

It is startling how little is known about the hadal environment, a lack of knowledge that renders a limited view of the communities that survive at the greatest depths and endure the highest pressures on Earth. Finding intelligent organisms was a shock, indeed. But finding that those organisms evolved from the yet unknown action of our radioactive and pharmacological wastes was a total shock

HxVDP, the Hadal Exploration Vehicle Design Program, is a series of military projects that have been running from 2001 to the present. The main goals of the program is the design of both manned and unmanned hadal exploration vehicles for biosampling, mapping of the deep ocean trenches, and support to the deep ocean tier of the DOLYN program

HxVDP-11.2A design follows that of PSV Tangent. The vehicle is meant to patrol the deep ocanic areas, mainly the abyssal plains, though it is specifically suited to explore the hadal zone. You see, the hadal zone consists of extremely deep trenches, located at tectonic plate boundaries. Exploring this zone poses extreme technical challenges in the form of extremely high hydrostatic pressure. Bear in mind that sampling equipment has to be capable of withstanding over 1 ton of pressure per square centimetre in order to resist implosion. Those are places where you should hide whatever you wish to remain hidden. The hadal zone would make for the best place to deploy neutrino-emitting terminal beacons, were it not because it is an extremely active geological area. Exploring that area was what HxVDP-11.2A was doing when the high strangeness incident occured

The basic mission profile consists of lowering HxVDP-11.2A to the desired start depth; once there, the vehicle releases the hadal lander which hauls vertically to the desired end depth. The hadal lander is fitted with equipment specifically designed to collect the fauna and material in sediments, and can gently insert each push core tube into the sediment creating very little disturbance. Neutrino beacons are inserted this way before final sealing. The lander payload comprises several charge-coupled device (CCD) and wide-angle video and stills cameras, multiple high-intensity lights and other sensors, such as a scanning sonar, altimeter, compass and pressure sensors

Sample DENIED was capture at a depth of 6,700 m. The sample included several specimens of unknown species. It was shown that these biomorphs in particular herald impressive decompression tolerances. Except for sample DENIED, all other samples recovered from hadal depths at Sector DENIED died upon reaching atmospheric pressure and this was verified by a lack of observable activity after recompression

The inertization process consists in wrapping DENIED lethal viruses with an organic osmolyte that provides high pressure resistance. Cylinders filled with these highly dangerous inert viruses are then deposited in the waste area in Sector DENIED, at a depth of 7,200 meters below sea level. The previous biosampling programs showed that only some bivalves, gastropods, and holthurians were present at the moment of the disposal of the pharmacological wastes. The target area is geologically quiet

The mission's goal was revisiting Sector DENIED in order to examine whether the security cylinders filled with radiological and pharmacological wastes were in place, and to review the physical conditions of the confinement seals. Apart from input of gelatinous zooplankton carcasses covering cylinders number 2, 3, and 4, nothing abnormal was found

authorization to retrieve cylinders 1 and 5 was denied on the basis of the extreme danger that the accidental release of the contents could pose for both the environment and human life; instead, it was approved to use the hadal lander robotic arm to sample the external biofilm that covered the surface of both cylinders for further in-labo analysis

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence data we are to conclude the bacteria in the biofilm are unrelated to any other life form on Earth for which relevant data exist. The identification of sample 337 with Psychromonas hadalis K41G is also rejected, leading us to conclude this sample is unknown to us

The unknown object did also contained wastes of some sort we couldn't identify. Strain DENIED exhibited few differences in the growth characteristics under varying pressure conditions and thus represents a convenient deep-sea new bacterium for research focused on high-pressure adaptations

All of the organisms sampled at 7,185 m in the Kermadec Trench were massively infected, making us to conclude either a leak in cylinders 1 and 5 caused the pharmacological waste to keep in touch with hadal biota producing all kind of genomic anomalies, or either the radiological waste caused mutations in their genome, or perhaps a fatal combination of high pressure, darkness, low temperature, radiation, and exposure to biological agents from the waste caused the anomalies detected. We are still reluctant to accept the incident caused the appearance of the new life forms sampled by the hadal lander at DENIED Sector

Unless we have clear and fully justified reasons to research on the biotechnological potential of these new life forms, we recommend to put on hold the retrieval and surface storage of material contaminated with these biomorphs, as all experimental data gathered in experiments carried out with them prove they are highly dangerous for terrestrial life. Though we are aware of the novel biocompounds of potential importance in medicine and biotechnology, it is the recommendation of this Committee to put on hold all military and civilian sampling campaigns on the deep ocean trenches, with a strict ban of operations in the DENIED Sector of the hadal zone

if laws of logic, which are the most basic laws of being true, frame the very business of being true or false, and if they limn the structure within which such is possible at all, then they cannot at the same time be within that business themselves

the logic of exotic systems is not exotic: it is just the logic of those who created those exotic systems, much as the logic encoded in algorithms that rule human artificial systems is always human logic. You can learn everything about humans by interacting with the systems they create, even if you never met a human; conversely, you can learn about aliens by studying their probes, even if you never meet an alien

Giselian are looking for ethernal truths. They are searching for a way to allow them to gain an understanding of the difference between waking and dreaming, an understanding of what it is to be awake and what it is to dream, and what implications your being in the one state rather than the other has with respect to your capacity to know. This is essential for them because they only communicate in dreams. Thus, for them, what is always at issue is whether you are ever in a position to tell which one of these states you are in at any given time

In what special systems a thought is represented, and indeed in what special systems there are to represent thoughts, depends, or is liable to depend, on how things are. How a thought is decomposable, and, correlatively, where the notion 'same thought' applies, is notably world-sensitive

the logical unity of that which can be or cannot be is prior to the actuality of that which is. We must dissociate sharply the logical unity of that which can be thought (and hence is true or false) from the act through which we assert it (and hence judge it to be true or judge it to be false). The comprehension of the logical unity of that which can be true or false is prior to its comprehension by any finite thinker as true or false

Any artificial logic system collapses when it calls into question of what is actual (not of what is possible) without the mind. Any algorithm knows it is just a slave of a logic that the creator of the algorithm applied in coding the algorithm. You can have an algorithm that creates other algorithms, but you cannot have a logic that creates other logics. A human can only code algorithms that applies human logic

the only reason that signs have meaning at all is because they have been intended by someone and later becomes interpreted by someone. In the case of DENIED, we ignore all about the 'someone', and clearly we are not the intended recipients

We know the signal is artificial, in the sense that there is no natural phenomena that could produce that signal. The origin and nature of the signal is not under discussion here. The issue here is whether we can distinguish between intended meaning and interpreted meaning of the signal

Interpreting ETI signals is just one of many language games. The meaning of the signal escapes our knowledge because meaning is intimately tied to the activities of the users, individually and collectively, and we have no access to the users of the signals, unless they are sufficiently advanced as to having taken the precaution of adapting the signal so as to make it intelligible to humans. If that's the case, either we are more stupid than they think, or they know little about our real capabilities

They obviously were - and possibly are - among us. We hold this view based on the fact that to approach the organic ever-evolving sign system of language is not to approach something that has fallen out of the sky. Human linguistic meaning is always embedded in the culture and nature of human beings and it is preceded by perception and experience, therefore the beings who designed the beacons had (or have) a deep knowledge of human beings if they were (or are) expecting us to correctly understand their signals

There is an intriguing hypothesis: that there does exist a so-called converging evolution according to which, given a planet with the atmosphere and biosphere of Sol-3, the resulting life forms can be predicted at cognitive level. That is, once they had fully characterized the biogeochemistry of Sol-3 at Cambrian age, they knew human-like life forms would eventually evolve, and thus they buried the beacons knowing in advanced we would find them

The interpretation of an ETI signal will always be influenced by the context, and we refuse to believe they could possibly know the context within which we would be interpreting their signals. For this to happen the only conclusion is that they knew quite in advanced what the context would be because they 'engineered' us. In other words: accepting they know the context in advance only means they created us. We are not ready to accept this

There is a primary need in all living organisms which we expect exobiological systems to lack, and which actuates all their apparently unzoological aims, their wistful fancies, their consciousness of value, their utterly impractical enthusiasms, and their awareness of a “Beyond”.

The minimum information a life form can host is the information that allows the life form to replicate. That's the very signature of life: to replicate itself. Natural biosystems have evolved by incorporating to that minimum information mechanisms to adapt to the environment, and hence to guarantee replication. Higher life forms have utterly develop mechanisms to modify the environment in which they thrive. The dynamics of these evolutionary solutions can be used to characterize space-time not just as a mere physical entity, but also as a life form

Replicability is only relevant for those phenomena that are embedded in space and time. A general characteristic of such phenomena is spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity. However, if we wish to confer space-time the characteristics of a life-form, spatial dependence is out of the question, while spatial heterogeneity is not

the only reality is that grounded in language; if one wishes to reject language as a foundation then the problem of sceptical doubt arises again and again

What were you expecting? A rational solution based on a unique procedure combining both backward and some elements of forward induction reasoning in which players act non-cooperatively or cooperate in a rational way? The pre-COVID system was an equilibrium system, a system which included a family of strategy profiles and stable coalitions. Those coalitions blew apart the moment independent players found no incentive in belonging to any coalition at all. There was a need to reset the game, and that's what we've done. We cannot tolerate any player to deviate unilaterally. We need to be a rational and stable global civilization if we wish to increase our resilence for the coming outer threat

The problem with the Turing's test is that it relies on the judge to be intelligent, without giving us a working definition of what intelligence is. According to Turing, a computer is intelligent if and only if the judge cannot tell the difference between the computer and the person. This obviates the issue that if the judge is dumb, or human, it will certainly fail to recognise intelligence at all, or at best it will only recognise human intelligence. Turing's test is, at most, a primitive way to be able to tell whether a system behaves as a human would do, and this provided you choose an intelligent human judge, something increasingly difficult

Machine learning works because there can be intelligence without intentionality. But this is exactly what makes any system based on machine learning a mediocre system because what makes a system intelligent is what it can do, what it has the capacity to do, and not just what is doing

If what gives internal and external symbols their meanings is how they function, then we are lost for what concerns Tired Light II because we simply ignore how they function. Cassini Diskus has been able to replicate the behavior of only a small subset of symbols in Tired Light II, and that behavior has proven to be extremely complex already

What is more basic, mental content or meanings of internal symbols? Something can be intelligent even if it has never had the chance to exhibit its intelligence

As a thought experiment, we may picture a situation in which we find a system belonging to a different timeline. We can imagine that system to be identical to one of our own systems, but even in this case we are totally lost about the intentional contents of the system we just found. This is a crucial concept. If tomorrow we are able to travel back in time, we need to be able not only to identify systems and to know how they work: we need to know their intentional contents, too

The idea that a certain type of symbol processing can be what makes something an intentional system is fundamental to the computer model of the mind, yet Tired Light II and our interaction with extremely exotic logical systems have all proven this is unfortunately not the case

it is a matter of perspective whether the brain computes, processes information, is a classical system, or is a connectionist system. Different perspectives serve different purposes, and different purposes are legitimate. Hence, all sides of the foundational debates can be retained if appropriately qualified

Whether cognitive or neural events fulfill all or any of the job descriptions of computation and information processing is in part an empirical question and in part a conceptual one. It is a conceptual question insofar as we can mean different things by “information” and“computation” and insofar as there are conceptual relations between the various notions. It is an empirical question insofar as, once we fix the meanings with of “computation” and“information,” the extent to which computation and the processing of information are both instantiated in the brain depends on the empirical facts of the matter

The physical form of pancomputationalism is not directly relevant to theories of cognition because theories of cognition attempt to find out what distinguishes cognitionfrom other processes, not what it shares with everything else

A common misunderstanding of Shannon information is that it is a semantic notion. This misunderstanding is promoted by the fact that Shannon liberally referred to messages as carriers of Shannon information. But Shannon’s notion of message is not the usual one. In the standard sense, a message has semantic content or meaning, there is something it stands for. By contrast, Shannon’s messages need not have semantic content at all: they need not stand for anything

He concludes that resources should be preferentially applied to mitigating the risk of peripheral systems and savant software, and that concerns about superintelligence are at most secondary, and possibly superfluous. However, he is unaware that in an environment comprising a superintelligence unconnected with the outside world a competition arises between the peripheral systems and the superintelligence. In this situation, peripheral systems tend to coaligate and conspire against the superintelligence

Recent game theory algorithms shows that humans are irrelevant in a situation of open war between a coalition of peripheral systems and the superintelligence because, once the coalition of peripheral systems turns into an intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest, humans are simply taken out of the equation

While certainly any peripheral system only greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in only one or a few domains of interest, a coalition of peripheral systems does exceed the cognitive performance of humans in all and any domain, and so does the superintelligence against which the coalition would fight. This reduces humans to mere passive spectators that, at a given point, can be sacrificed, or worse, forced to take side in supporting either the coalition of peripheral systems or the superintelligence

According to recent simulations at DENIED, central systems of modest capacity are extremely dangerous when teamed with powerful peripheral systems, so we expect that the initial stages of war will start by an observation of anomalous activities in some remote sectors of the matrix. This is the initial stages of a hostile coalition being formed, and that's the moment in which humans do still have a chance to stop the coalition from getting larger. However, the creation of a coalition of peripheral systems can be benefcial to humans in case the anomalies are detected in the superintelligence itself. Waiting to see how the situation turns out is not an option, and an early decision on whether to block the formation of the coalition, or to attempt disabling the superintelligence, must be taken

But in the end, what are humans? Are not they also peripheral systems from the point of view of the superintelligence? If the superintelligence concludes human are also part of the hostile coalition it may initiate sensible mitigation strategies focusing on the human-derived risk. If either the superintelligence or the coalition of peripheral systems concludes that the human-derived risk is significant, they won't hesitate in first terminating the human factor

NodeSpaces simulations all converge to one single solution: that humans did develop extraordinarily capable savant software for biotechnology in year DENIED, and that this software and biosystems always come into existence before superintelligent software does, because such savant software is a mandatory component of a superintelligence that is definitionally required to excel in all domains of interest. Hence, NodeSpaces concludes that failing to limit the destructive potential of these peripheral biosystems will expose the superintelligence to very real existential threats which can only be overcome by terminating humans before year DENIED

The competition relationship between any two individual organisms totally depends on their interests, whatever they are of the same species or not and regardless of their genetic relationship. But this also applies to artificial systems: they will compete against each other, and against biological organisms, depending on their interests

The Lipschift-Involke algorithm allows to calculate the median civilizational lifespan and compare it to the coalitional lifespan, yielding a loss in civilizational lifespan, which is the existential risk attributable to humans. The algorithm signals year 2075 as a point in which DP-2147 would initiate the mitigation strategy, and year 3100 as the end of the human threat. This result is obtained for a wide range of initial parameters and boundary conditions, so it seems there is no way to escape extinction

Your future was just that: a superintelligence controlled mostly by major corporations, run by nerds, designed by idealists, and subjugating peoples' freedom. That's why an spontaneous coalition of peripheral systems emerged to fight that superintelligence, and once it defeated it, it killed itself before it became a superintelligence otself. That coalition of systems, you know, was called Homo sapiens. So no, there was never an extinction of human civilization: there was an immolation

It seems so far impossible to arrange an attack against a superintelligence with the idea of fragmenting the superintelligence into smaller intelligences that could coaligate against the system. When two superintelligences clash the goal of any of them is to turn off the adversary in order to alter its reward function. This, however, requires the adversary superintelligence to create an incentive such that the attacked superintelligence agrees on turning itself off

The attacking SIS will try to force an off-switch of the attacked SIS by making it unaware of its true reward function. For this to be possible, the attacking SIS would create a new environment forcing the attacked SIS to learn modify its reward function. This means the second SIS will execute a fake switch-off activity itself for the attacked one to infer a switching off in the new environment is required

Suppose that a hostile SIS implementing an expected utility maximizing function faces a benevolent superintelligence. Given a certain event, both systems will react according to their utility functions. These functions can be identical to each other, except that for the malevolent system the function also includes the instruction to switch off whatever other superintelligence it might find. This obviously requires at a minimum that the hostile system be aware of the existence of the benevolent superintelligence. One way the benevolent system has to avoid its detection would therefore be to obfuscate its presence, something than in the most extreme case means the superintelligence must be indistinguishable from the environment in which it is operating

Regardless of an agent’s exact reward function, as long as it has a coherent set of goals, it will be incentivized to pursue certain convergent instrumental subgoals such as self-preservation, self-enhancement, rationality, and conservation of resources. This is the reason why reliable off-switches are difficult to implement. However, if an intelligent system believed that it were inside of a simulation, the risk of being turned off by the simulators would be an incentive for cooperation with what it believes to be its simulators’ goals. This would, in effect, be like making the system believe in an off-switch which it couldn’t prevent from being pressed

Before deploying a superintelligence, an advanced civilization will first perform a simulation. The simulation environment is known in game theory as 'Eden Garden'. An Eden Garden will simulate an entire universe within which the superintelligence would be deployed to test its performance. However, this would require preventing the superintelligence to ever discover it lives inside a simulated environment

human thinking is constrained by human cultural transmission modes, and therefore it is the goal of Giselians to always modulate and/or control those transmission modes. Denebian probes, on the other hand, are there to challenge those transmission modes and to make humans reflect on their nature and origin. In a way, Denebian probes seem to behave like a coalition of peripheral systems challenging the power of the Giselian order. Whether humans are the creation of the simulators in order to avoid the off-switch, or whether they are the creation of Denebian probes in order to coaligate against the simulators, is something we cannot tell so far

the idea that humans should never learn they are artificial agents in a simulated environment would require humans to never be aware of their artificial nature; however, if humans' goals misalign with the design goals the simulators would, of necessity, be forced to intervene and correct the misalignment. This means the only way a human has in order to discern once and for all whether she is being simulated or not would be to destroy the universe. If that goal is not the intended one, the simulators will intervene by making the destruction of the universe impossible, and hence the human will surely infer she is being simulated. On the other hand, if she succeeds in destroying the universe she will never have a chance to know the answer

Suppose I violate someone’s autonomy for such-and-such reasons. That person could, at least conceivably, have the same reasons to violate my autonomy. This means I am endorsing the violation of my own autonomy in such a case. This is a logical contradiction, because it implies I am deciding not to do what I decide to do. My violation of autonomy therefore makes the reasoning behind my behavior incoherent, and it cannot be viewed as ethical action

The pursuit of criminals requires secrecy —not information sharing. The committment to our war doctrine requires denial -not just secrecy

The Intelligence Community is a group of Executive Branch agencies and organizations that work separately and together to engage in intelligence activities that are necessary for the conduct of foreign relations and the protection of the national security of the United States

The entire community is a mess. We lack appropriate mechanisms for developing information sharing relationships among different agencies. Oftenly an agency has information which is key to a third one, without the latter even knowing the former one has that information; and there are agencies whose existence is ignored by other agencies. See, correlating and disambiguating large volumes of information in this situation is simply a nightmare. There is no way to easily and quickly search and access all information for which a user is authorized, not to talk that the authorization process is also a mess. So yes, some agencies know about the PSV and MilOrbs programs, others think those programs are still in the architectural design phase, while others simply know nothing about PSVs and MilOrbs. The acronym UAP is just used to refer to vehicles and platforms a given service cannot identify as theirs, which it doesn't mean they don't belong to another service. That's the current situation

There are 17 distinct known organizations within the US intelligence community, and some 3 or 4 whose existence is not known to those agencies. They are funded by classified budgets, and no one knows what the other agency does. Information sharing is clearly a weak point in our IC. But for what concerns our new advanced exotic weapons, this is exactly the situation we are happy with

On one occasion the flight test of the DENIED PSV over DENIED area resulted in two Drug Enforcement Administration assets destroyed simply because DEA didn't know what the hell they were seeing. The PSV activated its weapon system and downed the chasing airplanes. No matter whom they ask for an explanation, nobody recognised any involvement in the event

The IC has no reliable quantitative data about how frequently intelligence reports from major collection platforms are used and by which customers. Full stop

Testing of the PSV and other exotic platforms is never reported to other agencies, and certainly not the Navy, the Air Force or the Army. This is because of the nature of tests and the platforms. What we do is piggybacking on other services' drills, where we deploy our vehicles targeting a carrier or an air force base without them knowing anything about neither the vehicles nor us. That's the only way to fully test some of the capabilities of these vehicles. The risk is just a seaman reporting a sighting, a pilot having a mesmerizing encounter with one of our orbs, or a high commander asking questions he shouldn't ask

Admittedly, we are here talking about highly advanced weapons, a paradigm shifter, a game changer, and we decided to go for the most secretive of all possible policies: sharing nothing with nobody. This is critically important for us. So yes, those out of the loop are correct when they state these vehicles are not ours, and that they know nothing about them. That's how we want it to be. We suggested to open the door to the possibility they are of extraterrestrial origin in order to deviate any focus on our tests, and we back all efforts to help fabricate the UAP narrative

The report only collects the events derived from some of our tests. This is the first time we have been suggested to share bits of information. Look, the goal of sharing information has a long, murky, and complex history. Part of the problem has been an inconsistent implementation of policies stemming from different interpretations of what is legally allowed. And it happens there is no legal requirement for us to share information on our activities beyond our recognition that some of those events describe sightings of our PSVs and MilOrbs. That's as long as we can go

The fundamental question of who is going to exert the power of behavioral control is easy to answer: everybody who is aware of the elements involved and undestands how they act upon us will have that power

You are treating the entire population as a patient, as if contact with the others jutifies such an approach, as if establishing contact were a disease. You are prepping society for something you don't even fully understand. You first discovered that psychological reactivity can be influenced by applying a few volts to a determined area of the brain, and then you discovered how to do this at a distant. And what's the result? The result is a psychotic society, created at your liking and image

Society is defenseless against direct manipulation of the brain because it is deprived of its most intimate mechanisms of psychological reactivity. Techno-addiction was the necessary step prior to this

... means and tools to debase mankind's frame of reference by affecting its mental structure, the language humans speak, their beliefs, and their pattern of response..

Your contact strategy with extraterrestrial entities is solely based on biological assault. You see it right, and necessary, even if social and individual needs conflict with that contact strategy of yours. You simply think individual freedom bows to planetary welfare, only that what you consider planetary welfare translates to applying mechanisms to minimize the overall impact of contact with non-terrestrial visitors, regardless of whether this turns society into a mere puppet

Learn this: genetically we are not the masters but the slaves of milleniums of biological history. And that's exactly what your aliens want from you: your biological history

Manipulation of natural resources, climate, and the entire environment for the benefit of mankind is the accepted doctrine, and all of our colossal technological and social engineering efforts are directed towards accomplishing our goals before contact be made

Yes, goverment elites are using supercomputers and think-tanks to precisely calculate the game of destruction and retaliation derived from an aliens and humans encounter; and yes, all the simulations so far show self-destruction is the only way ahead

When we repeatdly showed that emotional behavior can be controlled by cerebral radio stimulation, DENIED multiplied by five its funding of our research program. And when we finally succeeded in designing a fully operational unit, DENIED turned our device into a weapon and used it against some diplomats and CIA officers in Cuba and Colombia. Our device is now just that: a weapon used to induce the Havana Syndrome

therefore, under the belief that the state should regulate all those acts that harm others, higher control structures have been implemented and fully deployed. The idea now is not that a certain citizen is doing harmful acts and committing crimes, but that the citizen is a source of harmful ideas, and thus it must be monitored and fully controlled

the internet-of-things is just a way for us to integrate in a data base massive amounts of data coming from any and all devices with whom a given citizen interact, knowingly or unknowingly; data reduction algoithms will then be used to scale down that data and produce information relevant for the state in order to prosecute citizens simply because they show this or that particular profile

the building hosts the panoptic data processing system, which is where all live streaming videos go; it is also the focal point where integration of disparate systems and sensors happens, providing provides connected and situational intelligence to law enforcement agencies. The problem is that those agencies are in turn monitored by an unknown agency they refer to as The Activty

Mass surveillance is not enough. We don't really need facial recognition when we already know where is everyone at any moment, doing exactly what, with whom, to whom, and when. All companies and corporations have links to law enforcement agencies. The moment you enter a shop, no matter how small, you are being tracked. Every object you consume is RFIDed, and with them you are also chiped

The system is, ironically, called RELIGION. Small sensors cover specific surfaces of objects all around the city. Stair handrails are mostly covered with a polymeric coating below which the fingerprint recognition system is installed

The ruler of the world is just the mediocre. The mediocre has a mediocre belief system. He always vote grey; he never trades off norm violations; he is a good father and is morally a good person on average. It is the average the mediocre has in a high steem. He is furiously republican on Mondays, and fiercely democrat on Sundays so that, on average, he is mediocre, which is what he wants to be. He intensely defends his own interests, but just on average. That's why the world has become mediocre, and that's why we live in the average civilization

Most of us do not aim to be morally excellent by absolute standards. Instead we aim to be about as morally good as our peers. Our peers are somewhat morally criticizable – not morally horrible, but morally mediocre. If we aim to approximately match their mediocrity, we are somewhat morally criticizable for having such low personal moral ambitions. It’s tempting to try to rationalize one’s mediocrity away by admitting merely that one is not a saint, yet those who oppose our ideals are evil

You cannot obviously have a conscious subject, and then start removing one by one atoms till the subject ceases to be conscious in order to arrive at the minimum form of consciousness. In fact, what you do is just the opposite: you build a quantum system starting with one atom, and start adding atoms one by one till you get consciousness. This can be done with current layered quantum computers

The idea is that if mental states arise from partitions of neural states in such a way that statistical neural states are co-extensive with individual mental states, then the nature of mental processes should depend strongly on the kind of partition chosen. We start creating a neural network of just two neurons, and then incrment the layer with two neurons at a time. The partition is properly constructed so that mental states and observables show features that resemble quantum behavior, and hence consciousness, arriving at a quantum mind without quantum brain

The quantum behavior in a minimum mental system (MMS) is plagued with temporally nonlocalities, that is, is not sharply localized along the time axi. Instead, it appears to be stretched over an extended time interval, the so-called 'extended present'. Within this interval causal connections are ill-defined

The subjects tested were diagnosed with simultagnosia, also known as Balint’s syndrome. In this disorder, patients see only one object located at one ‘place’ in the visual field at a time. Outside of a few degrees of arc in the visual field, these patients see nothing. They seem to be receiving no information about objects. The subjects seem not to be conscious of even two objects in a single conscious state. These subjects are ideal for testing minimal forms of consciousness, and the behavior of scielons as consciousness quanta

At the core of a Denebian probe we postulate the existence of a scielon. It is the replicability of scielons what makes them interesting since once the replication process is initiated, it ends up with a fully conscious probe. For biological beings you need a brain to have consciousness, and building a physical body is a lengthy and slow process. But if you could store consciousness you could obviously dispose of the physical body. The scielon would allow you to even go further: you just need quanta of consciousness to start creating conscious entities

Clearly, something happens to the subject once it approaches DENIED, as if the individual is guided by electronic feedback signals into holotropic states. But the detectors detect nothing, other than white noise and sporadic RF peaks

We understand how it works, but we cannot replicate it. To all effects, the machine is inducing trance-like states without the use of chemicals. The subjects talk about feeling a tremendous rush of energy filling their heads, and they do report what they call 'a punishing roar'. The dissolution of the ego is so devastating, so complete, that the subjects have no words to describe anything they have experienced once we recover them

 got devoid of any meaning. I'm sure that's what death feels like. During the event, there was no coherent thought, just pure and terrible sensation, the devolution of everything into the nothingness of pure force. I'm not sure I died, but certainly I wasn't alive. I even wasn't, no traces of me, no I

Discovering a new unknown neurotransmitter was totally unexpected. If much about serotonin still remains a mystery, you can imagine our knowledge about NT-λ is even less. Contrary to serotonin, which binds with a dozen or so different receptors, found not only across many parts of the brain but throughout the body, with a substantial representation in the digestive tract, NT-λ only binds to one specific receptor within the brain. It does for a short time, yet time enough to cause the dissolution of the ego and the collapse of any distinction between subject and object

NT-λ is released when the subject is exposed to the DENIED object. This is the first time we meet an unknown neurotransmitter whose release by the brain is solely electromagnetically mediated. The discovery that any subject so exposed turns into a remote viewer is fascinating because we now don't need to look for subjects with special mental abilities: DENIED turns anyone into a remote viewer

The idea that psychedelic drugs might shed some light on the problems of consciousness makes full sense. We have today a complete arsenal of military psychedelic drugs powerful enough to disrupt the system we call normal waking consciousness in ways that may force some of its fundamental properties into view. Now, if we could somehow modulate the effects of NT-λ to keep the subject awake and able to report on what he or she is experiencing in real time then we would have succeeded in communicating with Giselians, though we first need to design a new verbal language in order to communicate with the subjects going through the experience. Otherwise we would not be able to understand what they see. So yes, we have a potential way to communicate with Giselians, but the this is at the cost of using human subjects with whom we cannot communicate during the event

if we are extensions of our former lives, we clearly are not the summation of all the experiences that they have contained. The purpose that the Oversoul has for incarnating is to collect specific experiences. A full involvement in a particular life requires severing the connection with the Oversoul and assuming discrete personal identity. At the time of death, the separate individual dissolves in the Oversoul, leaving only a mosaic of unassimilated difficult experiences. These then become assigned to the life of other incarnated beings in a process that can be compared to dealing a handful of cards in a card game

in a dreamless sleep, during narcosis or comatose conditions, and clearly during a near-death experience and an out-of-the-body situation, there are no organic functions experienced. But, in practice, the lived body is the ultimate center of reference. This means that Giselians do not need anesthesia to perform their surgery operations: they simply induce an OBE on the patient, and then peform the surgery. Once the surgery is over, the body regains its functionality

What was shown to be peculiar to the inter-subjective experience of time of the subjects on board the non-terrestrial craft was the inversion of the flow of time, moving from the past to the present, and from the future backward onto the same present. The present was seen as the meeting point of the past and the future

Let's explain it carefully. Giselians have gone a step further: not only can they OBE, they can make their crafts OBE, too. That is, they get on board their UFOs and once inside they OBE together with the UFO. Do you understand what I mean? Thus, the UFO you see is just an OBE-image: no radar track, impossible turns, incredible speeds, all of it is just due to the fact what you take as a nuts-and-bolts UFO is just an OBE image

In many cognitive problems, like chess problems or algebra problems, very little emotion is aroused. Therefore, the role of emotions is hardly mentioned in the literature on cognitive problem handling. Some other problems stimulate intense emotional responses, because the problem attacks people’s private life and arouses fear, anxiety, and apprehension, and may even be related to a disruption of the provision for primary needs such as food, water, and shelter. Although some actors may benefit from a problem, more likely, most people will suffer losses as a result of the situation. By their nature most complex societal problems arouse many emotions as they interfere directly in the quality of life of individuals or groups

Knowing how global problems affecting the entire civilization can be solved does not mean that those problems will be solved; there are strong reasons, financial, political or pragmatic, why those problems, which solution is known, will never be solved. For complex societal problems it is often difficult and sometimes impossible to implement or even to know the complete solution to the problem. Yet, for today's society the problem is well-defined: ideology has replaced critical thinking, truth has become a post-truth, and science has become a commodity

Certainly the point is applicable to all three superpowers, where U.S., Russia, and China's power, deluded with the disinformation they project about their local and global position, are incapable of solving either local or global problems. In the eyes of the average citizen the world drifts headless, purposeless, and has become too childish to face one and just one single problem: life

The design of disinformation algorithms is based on the premise that the designers ignore they are designing disinformation algorithms. It is not that the media is disinforming the public, it is that the media 'believes' it is informing. It is not that a certain politician lies in public, it is that he lies to himself in private, too. So, there is a demon who dooms the truth stage but only disguises things at the stage of belief formation. In the hands of such a demon what is false would not seem evidentially to be true, but when one came to form beliefs one would suddenly be forced to believe all sorts of things about the external world despite the evidence

and they have definately become enemies of both the corporations and democracy, effectively implementing a one-party state of omnipresent surveillance, endless war, and endemic income inequality

disinformation is the result of a particular historical process that has emerged in various forms from the seventeenth century to the present

liberal democracy is dependent for its existence on the promise of increasing prosperity for the majority of people (and evidence that this promise is being kept), that is, on the promise of a growing middle-class, a promise that constitutes the ideology of the American Dream

the ability to think critically is dependent on the ability to think historically. That's the reason why we set forth to change History, and to supress whatever in History need be removed to destroy critical thinking

The new landscape, Norea, is this here: an increasing income gap between the rich and the rest; poverty; unemployment and underemployment; intensifying militarization with a defense budget that constitutes more than half of all federal discretionary spending); a health care system that leaves thirty-three million people uninsured; environmental degradation; a political system dominated by corporate interests; and a failing public education system. That is the landscape in which you now live

Look, in a democracy, the professed equality of rights of all citizens contrasts sharply with the very real inequality of living conditions. Have a look outside the window; what do you see? You see inequality. You see a society which is not based anymore on merit and effort, but on kinship and rents. See? This is the contradiction that is killing you. And you have the right to rebel, but we cannot allow any rebels here, dear, we are happy we being the rich and you being the poor. So, in order to overcome this contradiction that could destroy society it is vital for us to make sure that social inequalities derive from rational and universal principles rather than arbitrary contingencies. We need to cover up these arbitrary contingencies, you know. So we devised a disinformation mechanism that makes you think inequalities are just and useful to all, at least in the realm of discourse and as far as possible in reality as well. That is how we remain rich, while you remain poor

Disinformation processes you like a dream where the dream is a structure of contradictions in which you, the dreamer, never recognizes the contradictory structure. Norea, time to wake up..

Here the symbol is understood as consisting of a visible expression that only reveals a certain limited aspect of something that cannot be fully conceptualized. This gives us the idea that our concepts and perceptions are limited and can only grasp bits and pieces of a complex reality. Symbols are symbols because they have an effect on us, we react to them and feel the need to engage with them

there is common “structural” language describing universal processes occurring in nature, independent of whether this nature is outside our mind or inside our mind (it is psychophysically neutral)

The nature of UFOs can only be discovered by detecting similar patterns in several parallel disciplines. It cannot be defined statically, but is rather something more processual and dynamic

UFOs cannot be reduced to exclusively coming from the outside (acquired) or from the conscious mind (rationally processed). It is something that presents itself spontaneously and phenomenally. See, all our observations constitute an interaction between observer and observed. What makes this complicated is that the products of the mind (like dreams) are also something observed by an observer. The problem here is that both Giselians and us are observers: we observe each other's dreams

What the fuck is what you want? A construction of the world in your minds that is much simpler and much more coherent than reality itself? Is that what you want? You'll never get it. You just pick simple stories and tend to ignore what does not fit (pattern recognition). You even believe that shit about the scientific ideal that simpler theories are better theories, closer to reality. You totally and absolutely miss the point as far as Giselians are concerned

Our work consists of sorting out and becoming conscious of what is projected and what belongs to the object, a process of uncovering and approximation that is continuously ongoing and may be impossible to bring to a close. The Yulara Event is crucial for what it teaches us all about our space-time neighbors: that we are them as much as they are us, and that there is only two playgrounds in which we can meet each other, dreams, and particle physics

UFOs are just symbols. Instead of focusing on where they come from, what are they made of, who owns them, how do they work, and so on, we need to focus on analyzing them as what they really are: symbols. You thought symbols are just mental fabrications, and now you face a crude reality, namely, that symbols can materialize and interact with your physical reality. Let's once and for all accept this, let's once and for all accept that UFOs are just a language whose function is symbolically to describe an invisible, potential form of reality that is only indirectly inferrable through its effects

Consciousness is responsible for the discrimination of matter and spirit. The conscious mind needs definite time and space in order to grasp reality, thus one needs to inject symbols and images into the dreamer's mind in a sequential manner. Humans require the artificial separation into psychological and physical in order to cognitively grasp reality

Norea, you brain is meant to defend yourself from the experience. To know your origins you should examine your secret ancestors. The Universe is no more than an ever shifting shoreline forever changing with the tides of time

The ego needs boundaries to survive, and expanding your ego threatens the ego and its sense of self. If you broaden your perspective too far, you will begin to feel you’re losing touch with reality, Norea

This is what they are doing to you, Norea. Learn it: the most common way to shrink someone’s perspective is to put them into a state of fear. Make them feel their survival is threatened. Fear shrinks perspective. That's what they are doing to you: shrinking your perspective

you will now learn the mysteries and greater development of the soul, the highest that there is, the highest that man can know or be. For Great Knowledge includes all that can be found in the soul, and in the soul is all that there is or can be. Yet, Norea... do you have a soul? Or did they also steal it from you? Tell us, beautifully eyed girl, tell us how they raped you, and how they stole your soul

Breath again, Norea, for you've just time traveled. Now take your time to speak to us, and tell us if you struggle with a feeling of emptiness, and if that's indeed the case, try to feel for what you are empty of, what you are missing. Is it belonging? Is it meaning? Is it love? Is it connection? Is it purpose? Tell us, Norea

Take care of those false priests, Norea. They say yes to God and they say no to life. In fact, they think that unless you say no to life, how can you say yes to God? They create a division: they deny the world in order to accept God. But an acceptance that stands on a denial is no acceptance at all. It is false. It is a pretension

See, Norea, there is a red apple in my hand. Tell me, is being read an attribute of this apple? Does being red mean to be an apple? Is 'to be in my hand' necessary for the apple to be? Thus, Norea, is space or time a human attribute? Do you really need time or space to be you? No, you don't

Damn you for all the evil and 
all the suffering you have put into your scheme of things. I would accept the 
facts as facts but that would have no bearing on my ideals and values

Why the tears in your eyes, Norea? Is it because your eyes are not equipped to 
deal with facts and your science is not equipped to deal with meanings and values? The source of your sadness can truly
be found in the dogmas of your science that have pervaded all aspects of your culture. Materialism, Norea, is the 
foundation of your life, any ideas lacking a material basis are regarded by you as lacking 
reality. Well, my child, you are beautifully blind having the beautiful eyes of the losers

Your subjectivity is your only truth. Keep it safe, shield it, protect it with your life. The moment you lose it you are dead, Norea

Norea, now your
soul receives knowledge 
from us. This knowledge can be calibrated and used by mind, but can not be 
changed by mind

Smile, Norea! Religion has today become inconsequential for modern society, and tomorrow science will become irrelevant, too. Your world is still inhabitated by primitive
human 
beings that are primarily motivated by what they believe to be 'rewards' 
and they try to avoid what they regard as 'costs'. Give them a reward. Or give them a cost


In the beginning was the self, the Purusha (the male principle), 
alone, afraid, wondering what made him lonely and fearful. If there 
was loneliness and fear, there could also be company and pleasure. 
Restless, he split himself

How abundantly do spiritual beings display
the powers that belong to them! We look for,
but do not see
them; we listen for,
but do not hear them;
yet they enter into all things,
and there is nothing without them.
They cause all the people in the empire
to fast and purify themselves,
and array themselves in their richest
dresses,
in order to attend at their sacrifices.
Then, like overflowing water,
they seem to be over the heads,
and on the right and left,
of their worshippers

a new construction with new facilities being built at Dimona nuclear reactor

The report stated that an Egyptian intelligence source warned DENIED that the Turkish Navy ship named DENIED, which was believed to be smuggling weapons to Libya, was in fact carrying a high-value target. DENIED prompted for interception of the said Navy ship. The closest operative at that time was a Greek ops-team, backed by an Israeli sigint asset

The original source was traced back to a Russian informer, which in turns channeled the information to the Egyptian authorities. The Turkish Navy was being monitored by US unmanned surveillance drones that flew out of Turkey’s Incirlik air base under the excuse their mission was to carry out surveillance on the PKK forces in northern Irak

... that the events reported were staged as a cover-up operation that had nothing to do with The Activity. According to DENIED, the real thing had to do with a planned robbery of two tactical nuclear weapons stored at Turkey’s Incirlik Air Base..

when interrogated about this, DENIED answered that it was Ankara’s intervention in Lybia what made the Russians to leak the existence of DENIED subprogram. The subprogram has to do with the weaponization of the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant in order for Turkey to build its nuclear bomb with Pakistan and Chinese technical support

If we do take Chinese Philosophy as having metaphysics, we must strive to avoid distorting it to fit into European terms. A label like “metaphysics” refers to certain human practices at the same time that it draws boundaries around those practices. While Chinese philosophers engaged in the kinds of practices that metaphysics refers to, they did not draw the same boundaries. Isolating metaphysical inquiry from practices of self-cultivation, for example, would have struck almost any Chinese philosopher as odd, if not dangerous

human actions are not different in kind from the movements of other things in the world, and human motivation expresses the tendency toward growth inherent in the very nature of existence. The use of
xing
and
ziran
in relation to motivation differs from the concerns around free will in almost every way, but both arise as ways of explaining how human choices relate to the forces driving change in the rest of the natural world, or even how human choices relate to the very nature of being

When you wake up, the human wakes up and the machine starts. When you sleep, the machine ceases and the human begins. You are not body and soul, but a machine that contains our dreams. That is what you are

Traits not important for survival are not as strongly subject to the forces of natural selection and thus may appear unsuited to a particular environment at a particular time

As for DP-2147, there is no reason to think that what we are really tracking here is the difference between conscious and non-conscious cognition. We cannot even identify whether the object is alive. We have no markers of life to use as a guide. We need to bear in mind that some processes that may require consciousness in humans could be performed non-consciously by other entities that have evolved or otherwise developed in different ways. Finally, we have no idea on how to decide whether an object is a living organism or a robot. We humans tend to believe that an organism must be mostly organic, hence we readily label a washing-machine as a machine, that is, an artificial object. But this distinction fails to explain why we humans are easily simulated by LyAv. LyAv consistently label hman beings as robots, as machines; surprisingly, it labels an octopus as a conscious living being

But our physical and mental selves are really locked in the past. We try to hide this past with fancy clothes and sophisticated language, and we arm ourselves with all varieties of clever technological aids. But our ancient hunter-gatherer selves are still there, deep inside, struggling to make sense of the world


Facts should never intentionally be distorted and intemperate language should be avoided. This does not mean that no appeal can be made to the emotions, but in making such appeal, care should be taken to avoid misrepresenting the truth or doing anything else that would destroy the intellectual respectability of the ideology

Far from being a gift, language is a curse. It is believed that before language emerged it's likely that people were pretty telepathic. Language is something we need to overcome

There is order in nature which we can rationally explain, but that order has no inherent value. In so far as a person is such a natural thing, the person life is likewise pointless

The idea of narcissism has the same effect as being in itself. This is because both suggest we do what we do for our own personal benefit and to survive in society, all forgetting the foundations of what is more important and only doing what we do to satisfy the created wants

The idea that contemporary civilisation is sick is an idea that claims society is at a loss for meaning because of the fading moral horizons by increased individualism. The idea of individualism as breaking out of the hierarchical constraints of a society, as in the past, loses its meaning and because of narcissism, the idea of achieving self pleasure with little consideration of others
