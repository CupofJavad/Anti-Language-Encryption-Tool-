the capacity to integrate information in the brain is a prerequisite for consciousness. Integrated Information Theory of consciousness provides a mathematical approach to quantifying the information integrated in a system, called integrated information. Integrated information is defined theoretically as the amount of information a system generates as a whole, above and beyond the sum of the amount of information its parts independently generate. IIT predicts that the amount of integrated information in the brain should reflect levels of consciousness

If the parts are independent, integrated information will not exist. Consciousness ceases when dissociation is acute
