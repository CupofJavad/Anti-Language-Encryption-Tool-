syntax is invaluable to an analytical mind in a combinatorial world

When two probes meet they start without a lexicon nor shared meanings, and play language
games in which they generate new meanings and negotiate words for these meanings.
That's the essence of Cassini Diskus. After a period of interaction both probes 
finally evolve a shared language in which they can communicate

In an intrinsically dedicated symbol system there are more constraints on the symbol 
tokens than merely syntactic ones. Symbols are manipulated not only on the basis of the 
arbitrary shape of their tokens, but also on the basis of the decidedly non-arbitrary 
shape of the iconic and categorical representations 
connected to the grounded elementary symbols out of
 which the higher-order symbols are composed. Of 
these two kinds of constraints, the iconic/categorical ones are primary
