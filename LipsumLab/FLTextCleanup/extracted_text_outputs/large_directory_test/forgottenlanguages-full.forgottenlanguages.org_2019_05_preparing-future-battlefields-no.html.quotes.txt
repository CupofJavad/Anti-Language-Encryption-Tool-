For us, testing the system against unknowing civilian airplanes means working in a secure and sanitized environment

it was approved and directly tested by the  Strategic Capabilities Office at DENIED during DENIED. Much as MALD-X, the system comprises a networked decoy that can use its adaptive electronic warfare payload  to deliver electronic attacks on air defense nodes autonomously or at the direction of operators from afar  in a semi-autonomous fashion. The system was initially conceived to blind various radars and air defense nodes,  but it soon came clear to us its potential to mess up target avionics

 PSV to jam a large airspace  sector within NAS, specifically targetting 737's airplanes near DENIED in a SouthCal-Seattle transect. We kept  Oakland ATC busy for a while, you bet. We targeted 737's Max because that aircraft model is the best-selling one. It was a natural choice, you know. But the very reason is that more than half of all commercial jetliners flying in China are made by Boeing...  the nickname we give these targets is TH, which stands for Trojan Horse
