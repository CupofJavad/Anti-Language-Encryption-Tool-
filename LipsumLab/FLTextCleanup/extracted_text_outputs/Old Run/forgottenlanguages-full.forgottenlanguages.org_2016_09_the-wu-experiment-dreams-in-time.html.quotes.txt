, and what they dream of is ours

we don’t directly observe macroscopic physical superpositions, but we do observe psychological superpositions. Indeed, we require specific psychological conditions for the unity of consciousness, yet before the colapse of the wavefunction we are bound to assume that several consciousnesses existed before there was only one

It is true that we simply need to know a bit about the way psychological states supervene on physical states in order to get the observational implications of the basic physical theory, but this is only required if the observer has a consciousness. If the observer is a Denebian probe, you don't need consciousness at all. Perhaps this explains why sending a Denebian probe is the safest way to explore a distant world
