The last function of reason is to recognize that there are an infinity of things which surpass it

it may be the case after all that there is some fundamental limit to time intervals, and so it becomes a matter of curiosity as to how far we can go along that road

intelligence could have evolved in our galaxy 4-5 billion years ago, since the oldest stars in our galaxy formed about 10-11 billion years ago; several lines of evidence agree that extraterrestrial intelligence could have emerged several billion years ago

this is the first observational evidence that we do live in an acausal universe. On the other hand, though it is widely believed that the existence of time machines must lead to some paradoxes in fact not a single such paradox has ever been found
