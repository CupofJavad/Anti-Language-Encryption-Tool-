The COVID pandemic provided a unique opportunity to hear, in certain areas of the ocean, the true underwater sonic environment. Maritime traffic was drastically reduced, allowing the DOLYN system to more accurately characterize the ocean background. Following the outbreak, we found an unprecedented drop in maritime mobility, across all categories of commercial shipping. With few exceptions, a generally reduced activity was observable from March to June 2020, when the most severe restrictions were in force

In the second half of March 2020, most European cruise terminals partially or in some cases completely suspended operations26 (e.g., 19 March in Italy, 20 March in Croatia, 25 March in Spain). In order to limit and slow the spread of the infection, many seaports closed down, limiting—and sometimes banning—cruise traffic at their terminals. The fishing and aquaculture sectors were also affected by containment measures, leading to, e.g., voluntary fishing cessation and suspension or reduction of fish farming, with evident effects on the supply chain of fish food products

Our analysis of AIS data shows that in all highlighted areas, on average, ships reduced their speed in March–April 2020 with respect to the same months in 2019. Under normal situation, the contribution of container ships, bulk cargo ships and tankers to underwater noise emissions is over 68%

During the COVID maritime traffic lockdown, DOLYN underwater sensors detected a series of enigmatic artificial sounds that piqued our interest and concern. The grid was activated in the DENIED area of the South Pacific Ocean. The sounds, characterized by a rhythmic pulsation and a low-frequency hum, were unlike any known marine life or typical human-made noise patterns. They emerged sporadically, often overlapping with the silence that enveloped the oceans during the reduced shipping activity. Initial analysis suggested a potential origin from an unidentified submersible or underwater construction activity, but the precise source remained elusive. Further analysis of the sounds raised questions about their purpose

For one thing, sounds below the surface differ from noises you hear above the waves. Underwater, noises travel farther. In one experiment from the early 1990s, researchers placed a speaker near Antarctica, played some low-frequency or deep-pitched sounds, and picked up those sounds near Bermuda, demonstrating that sound can literally travel halfway around the world. On March, 27th 2020 we were deployed south of the Akademik Kurchatov Pacific Ocean Fracture Zone, at DENIED checkpoint. We know that today's identified acoustic hotspots will present substantial climate-change-induced sound speed variations toward the end of the century, potentially affecting our systems' performance. We expect an impact of such variation on underwater sound transmission. On March, 27th 2020 we were running tests of our adaptive DENIED system at the DENIED checkpoint, located at a depth of 3000 m

The Mackenzie formula exploits the link between temperature, salinity, depth, and sound speed. It is a nine-term, eight-variable equation to compute sound speed in the ocean, valid in a range of temperature between −2° and 30°C, salinity 25–40 psu, depth 0–8,000 m. The formula stems from data gathered at 15 worldwide stations and calculations of sound speeds for each pressure

We employed advanced signal processing techniques to isolate and analyze the sound patterns further. At the time of detection the rhythmic pulsations exhibited a distinct modulation that suggested a deliberate structure, hinting at a potential intelligence behind the noise. We cross-referenced the data with known underwater phenomena using the DOLYN database, but nothing matched the unique characteristics of the sounds. The absence of maritime traffic during the lockdown provided a rare opportunity to capture these anomalies without the usual cacophony of human activity, so we focused solely on the mysterious signals

Each new data point added layers to the puzzle, revealing variations in frequency and intensity that hinted at a possible network of sounds rather than a singular source. We wondered whether the signals we were picking could represent a new form of underwater communication, or perhaps an undiscovered technology

The only match found in the DOLYN catalogue was a signal picked by a AN/SQS-53C in DENIED five years ago. The old AN/SQS-53C, housed in a bulbous dome mounted on the hull of a ship, uses pulses centered at 2.6-3.3 kHz (and ranging from 1-5 kHz), with effective source levels of 235 underwater dB at 1 m with ping lengths of approximately 1-3 sec. The new AN/SQS-53D is still under testing. In any case, the correlation with our signals was low enough as to discard this match

The DICASS sonobuoy is an active acoustic sonobuoy used by the Navy to detect submarines. The command activated part of the system allows DICASS buoys to receive radio transmissions instructing the buoy to change depth, activate sonar transmissions, or scuttle tself. Active sonar pulses can be transmitted at four frequencies (6.5 kHz, 7.5 kHz, 8.5 kHz, and 9.5 kHz) and can operate for up to one hour at depths of up to 457 m, a depth which is too shallow for our purposes

When you face a situation like the one we are discussing, you usually perform analysis of the mysterious underwater sounds having in mind that they might originate from an unidentified marine mammal. Although the rhythmic patterns and tonal qualities bore a resemblance to the communication calls of certain cetaceans, particularly those known for their complex vocalizations, we began to notice subtle discrepancies that set these sounds apart from typical marine mammal calls

We identified unique harmonic structures and frequency modulations that were not characteristic of any known species. This led us to consider the possibility that the sounds were not of natural origin but rather a sophisticated biomimetic defense signal. Our concern is that, to our knowledge, no one has such a system, let alone one that works at a depth of 3,000 meters. So the signals are artificial, but they are not ours

We were not close enough to the Akademic Kurtchatov trench for certain features of the mysterious signals to be explained by geological dynamics processes, nor is there a marine mammal capable of emitting signals like those detected. Moreover, the signals did not come from a single source, but from a network of sources

Encrypting sensitive information and transmitting it by mimicking biological signals is a technique we have been using for probably a long time. When you hear a whale's vocalizations, you have to see the whale to be sure it's not one of our DOLYN signals. But what we would never do is obfuscate our signals using biological signals at a depth where there are no animals that could emit them. This is elementary

There is something down there that is not of natural origin and is not human. We want to know what it is, not because we are interested in the mysteries of the cosmos. For us there is no mystery: the human being is a superpredator that kills other humans, and our lives depend on not being the prey. In the next world war, everything will be played out at a depth of 3,000 meters. That's what we're focused on
