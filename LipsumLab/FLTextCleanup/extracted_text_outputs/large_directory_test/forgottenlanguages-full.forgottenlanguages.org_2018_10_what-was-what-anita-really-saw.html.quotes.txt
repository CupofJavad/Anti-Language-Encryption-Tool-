I don't think the signals to be anthropogenic. I do agree a tau neutrino seems more reasonable despite the fact similar events have not been see by either the IceCube detector at the South Pole or the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina. A third possibility is that the signals are neither cosmological nor anthropogenic, which leaves open the possibility of those signals coming from a Giselian beacon

SV17q message was quite clear: we should work under the hypothesis that event 15717147 is a t-lepton initiated air shower. Any mention to a possible anthropogenic origin would mean problems for us . That was the message, you see
