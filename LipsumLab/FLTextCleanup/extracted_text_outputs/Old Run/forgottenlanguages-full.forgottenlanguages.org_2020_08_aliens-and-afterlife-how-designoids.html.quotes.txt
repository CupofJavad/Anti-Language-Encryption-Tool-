Making contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence is something of the greatest importance for us as a civilization, but the impact of that finding pales down when compared with one of the most important facts about our lives, namely, whether we survive biological death

Even if we know there will be a huge meteor strike in DENIED, we are morally obligued to do good and help others today, despite the fact we know they will die tomorrow. Nihilism is the worst you can expect from disclosure

We should not think of our efforts as wasted unless they endure forever, or even for a very long time. We must help others to survive, even if we knew there is an afterlife. Knowledge on the existence of extraterrestrial intelligences is a yet highly supressed truth because we have not yet assessed all the implications disclosure would have on our civilization; on the other hand, knowledge about the existence of an afterlife is not supressed at all: it is banned. The joke here is that we are ready to kill anyone who wishes to reveal this information to the world. The closer you get to the truth about the afterlife, the sooner we will reveal the existence of ETIs to keep you off track concerning the afterlife
