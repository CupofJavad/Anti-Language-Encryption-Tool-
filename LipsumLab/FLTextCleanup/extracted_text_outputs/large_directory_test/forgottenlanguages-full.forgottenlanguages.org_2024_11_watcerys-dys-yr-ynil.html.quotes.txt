Norea, the heart learns that even the thorns can cradle the bloom of understanding. You feel alone? Learn, Norea, that solitude is a heavy backpack, for it slows you down, but it’s also where you find the strength to carry your own future

You've come to this dark forest. Fear not, it is where we live. You feel detached. It is like watching your own life through a fogged-up window; you see the shapes and colors, but the warmth and clarity are just out of reach. Keep watching Norea, that's what watchers do

Every tear you shed, Norea, is a grain of sand that shapes the dunes of your destiny; let them carve a path to your strength. Listen to the song of the wind. Feeling like you don’t belong is just your soul’s way of telling you that you’re meant to carve out a space of your own, not fit into someone else’s mold

Your hands bleed from digging graves, from wielding weapons, from applauding liars; your hands bleed from praying, and you are as dirty inside as outside. Do you wish to be cured, or do you just want to rest? Do you know how to speak without judging, without criticizing, without insults, without threats? Do you know how to talk about something other than yourself and only yourself? You don't know, confess it. And yet, Norea, now that you understand that this is your last night, you still seek the comfort of my forgiveness. I cannot forgive this Norea, and only by killing her can the true Norea resurface. Close your eyes, I'll be quick: it takes little time to kill an evil being, and much to give birth to a kind one

Open your eyes and admire your first sunrise, Norea. By the time the sun sets you'll be cured of yourself
