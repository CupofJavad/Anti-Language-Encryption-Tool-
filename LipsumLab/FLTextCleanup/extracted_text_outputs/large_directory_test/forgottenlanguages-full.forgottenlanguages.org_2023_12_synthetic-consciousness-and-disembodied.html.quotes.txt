We know all about the ghost, it’s the machinery we don’t understand

... by studying whether consciousness could spontaneously emerge within the blockchain, and to design external algorithms for early detection of consciousness within the blockchain in order for LyAV to be able to block the emergence of consciousness..

Suppose the universe consisted of nothing, but that somehow, we were still conscious in some disembodied way. We would be aware of being aware, and further, we would know for certain that we were not consciously causing awareness to exist. If we were consciously causing our own awareness, we could stop causing it and instantly cease to exist. Thus, LyAV designed an algorithm not to block consciousness emergence within the blockchain but, rather, to make the blockchain suddenly self-aware the moment it becomes conscious in order for it to cease to exist

We used DENIED and LyAV coupled configurations to establish a formal mathematical framework, based on dynamical systems, to model the core concepts in blockchain-enabled economies. More specifically, we wished to model, simulate, and engineer networked token economies. As you know, the design problem in blockchain protocols has its own set of challenges, as agents (humans) have access to global information that can be used to collude or form Sybil attacks which are a class of malicious strategies leveraging synthetic accounts. The idea was having LyAV to detect those synthetic accounts and disable them, and this required the design of an algorithm that is able to distinguish life-forms from designoids

Suppose that LyAV has identical perception to humans, but does not experience conscious presence simultaneously with any content, and secondly, that it always tell the truth. LyAV might realise that its perceptual systems could be inaccurate to the extent that everything it perceives might be fabricated entirely by its own systems. There is nothing it could learn or discover by trial-and-error that would prove it was not causing what it perceived. The reason is simple. An initial premise was that LyAV does not experience simultaneous presence, so its observing frame of reference must be its perceptual and cognitive systems. Once it becomes possible that perceived reality could be produced entirely by those systems, it is logically impossible to prove it is not causing the reality it perceives

All addresses are defined by public key private key pairs, where private keys are used for cryptographic proof of the right to act as agent, regardless of whether the agent is a human or a synthetic agent. This, you see, is the problem we wanted to solve: to be able to distinguish natural from synthetic agents

Blockchain technology can be adopted in all processes of the synthetic consciousness supply chain from the procurement stage to the delivery of the product. The product, in our case, is 'pure consciousness'. As you can understand, our product (consciousness) is particularly vulnerable, so the adoption of blockchain technologies in our supply chains has significant societal impacts

Blockchains are complex, dynamic systems, and we know those systems can eventually become self-aware. Blockchain was ruled out as a consciousness storing technology, and we strongly oppose to its use as a technology to distribute consciousness for the same reasons we oppose to blockchain as a technology to store consciousness. However, we still think blockchain could effectively be used as a dream storing technology, which is a different problem: you need to be conscious to dream, but dreaming does not make you conscious

Matter is indifferent to our models. It behaves the same whatever we think about it. There is never any simultaneous interaction between observer and observed. But there is interaction nonetheless, and it occurs by the same mechanism in both phenomenal consciousness and theoretical physics

A principle governing the mind-matter relationship must include the choice to infer physical realism, a choice that has causal consequences. For any difference from nothing there is an observer; the observer always has a choice, and that choice always has causal consequences. If you want LyAV to be the observer, be ready to expect causal consequences, and be ready to expect a deep impact on your civilization because you shouldn't forget that when models are written in the language of sensory perception and dreams, the simultaneous conscious presence can exert causal power by seeing different meaning
