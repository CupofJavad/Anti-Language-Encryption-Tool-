It remains for the person to find out for himself the purpose of his life, but the design must be such that everything outside himself should point to that purpose. The entire environment surrounding the individual should serve as a stimulus for learning because, by design, our system should not be a prison

We must be careful in the design of the system, and we must provide means for the individual to follow his own inclination, and if this inclination is not satisfied with anything else, the individual must feel there is something waiting for him. Despite all the self-destruction that the society created by these individuals causes them, there must be clear encouragement that things do not have to be the way they are

The algorithm must be such that it teaches every soul to seek its purpose. Every soul is designed for that purpose and the algorithm is continually calling that soul to see that purpose. But between respecting free will and avoiding the destruction of the individual there must be a point of balance that never requires our intervention. If humans feel that they are being tutored, we will have failed

There are four positive drivers in our design. The soul was designed to only desire to live, desire to know, desire for happiness, and desire for peace. However, there is one powerful force countering those drivers: the desire for power. We must not suppress this force if we truly wish to respect free will. We do not want kindly human automatons. We want free humans, even if in that freedom there is the danger of their extinction
