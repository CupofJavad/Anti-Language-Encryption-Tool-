If we could merge all the information available from different agencies and services around the world, then we would have a much more accurate picture of what these extraterrestrial phenomena are. But, look, no agency wants to surrender a particle of authority to the others, so that unfortunately everything we know about these beings is fragmentary, scattered, inconsistent

We know of many places in our universe that concentrate more matter and energy than the Earth, but not of places that concentrate more information, except for that anomaly called DP-2147. You know, information is not tangible; it is not a solid or a fluid. It does not have its own particle either, but it is as physical as movement and temperature, which also do not have particles of their own. Information is incorporeal, but it is always physically embodied. Information is not a thing; rather, it is the arrangement of physical things. It is physical order

It is hard for us humans to separate information from meaning because we cannot help interpreting messages. We infuse messages with meaning automatically, fooling ourselves to believe that the meaning of a message is carried in the message. But it is not. This is only an illusion. Meaning is derived from context and prior knowledge. Meaning is the interpretation that a knowledge agent, such as a human, gives to a message, but it is different from the physical order that carries the message, and different from the message itself. Meaning emerges when a message reaches a life-form or a machine with the ability to process information; it is not carried in the blots of ink, sound waves, beams of light, or electric pulses that transmit information

As I said, meaning is derived from context and prior knowledge, and whoever designed DP-2147 knows that. That object is the only possible means of contact, but we are unable to understand either the object or the message or the context

Living organisms are highly organized structures that process and produce information but, unlike information, knowledge and know-how are embodied in humans and networks of humans that have a finite capacity to embody knowledge and know-how. Recovering that object, if that's even possible at all, has a value, a value stored not in the object’s atoms but in the way those atoms were arranged. That arrangement is information

In this Universe anomalies are short-lived. Anomalies are eventually destroyed by the bloody claws of entropy. Our species’ capacity to compute requires social networks to function, and it is therefore affected by institutions and technologies. These institutions and technologies involve the fragmentation of human languages, discrimination, trust, and communication and transportation technologies, among others. Inadequate institutions and technologies can trample our ability to form the networks we need to accumulate knowledge and knowhow, limiting the rate at which we can make information grow. And if we keep withholding information about non-terrestrial intelligent entities from each other we will never move forward

It is easy to criticize SV17q, but what ought one do when one is uncertain about what one ought to do? Human operators with total control over a superintelligent system could give rise to a moral hazard of extraordinary proportions by putting unprecedented power into the hands of a small few. So there are only three options: confine the ASI, destroy it, or simply prevent it from being used at all costs. The important thing here is to understand how the probes work: they are placed in the vicinity of a planet's technosphere and allow your computer, in this case LyAv, to transform itself into a superintelligence. But for this to happen, very strict requirements must be met and you must first go through many filters

We are indeed trying to predict a future contact scenario, dependent on future unknown algorithms and the solutions to whole host of problems we can’t yet even see. We are here dealing with a non-terrestrial intelligence. We cannot anthropomorphise it, or expect it to interpret things the way we would. We have to articulate all the implicit limitations before attempting any contact. Which may mean coming up with a solution which is an unpleasant and painful solution for mankind
