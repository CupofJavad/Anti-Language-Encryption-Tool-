At
least for that region of the Universe, space-time exhibits an inbuilt indeterminacy. In it, particles float and sense a continual chronon bombardment; this sensation is called time. In our region of the Universe, we are used to conceive timelines along which wordlines extend, and those timelines are supported by the so-called 'line of existence' or LoE

Let
's
not forget that not only is it theoretically possible to open a passage between two points of space and to travel almost instantaneously between the stars but that we might also be able to travel in time. For what we know, the maximum distance we can travel back and forth is 12,000 years, which sets an upper limit for the existence of a D-civilization like ours

But
what we observe in that region of the Universe is a situation in which the line of existence is not aligned with the timeline, as they diverge by a certain angle phi. This allows for the relativistic cases in which closed-timelike curves emerge, though the cause-effect relations are somewhat exotic

if
we consider empty space-time as an immaterial substance composed of a very large numberof tiny building blocks and then let these microscopic blocks interact with each other according to the simple rules dictated by gravity and quantum theory, they spontaneously organize themselves into a collective whole that resembles the universe observe today. This includes The Void, which is precisely the region of space in which causality breaks down

It
acts as two separate time machines connected through a traversable bulk wormhole, only that we have not found any megastructure who could serve as the time machine. There is nothing in that void, I mean, no structured objects of any kind. Just a void. A probe entering that region of the Universe reemerges at the other side instantaneously, but it reemerges with all of its surface deteriorated and aged as if it would have experienced the passage of time

one
could use quantum entanglement to teleport an excitation to the closed timelike curve region of another time machine: instead of crossing a divergent stress at the boundary, one takes a dive below, so to speak, into the bulk, to emerge at the closed timelike curve region in the other boundary

A
technologically advanced E-civilization that is able to artificially create closed timelike curves in order to travel in time would do so only if it can guarantee the pre-existence of a K-civilization, because the existence of such K-civilization is a prerequisite for the existence of an E-civilization. This means the K-civilization must signal its line of existence to any E-civilization located in its future timeline
