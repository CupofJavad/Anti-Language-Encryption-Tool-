The essence of the electromagnetic field theory of consciousness is that conscious perceptions – and also conscious sensations or qualia, inasmuch as they can be said to have independent existence – are identical with certain brain-generated spatiotemporal electromagnetic patterns

the electromagnetic field theory of consciousness predicts that in principle, consciousness could be generated using hardware instead of wetware. This single prediction not only renders the electromagnetic field theory testable where the neural identity theory is not – it also opens wondrous vistas with respect to possible future technologies
