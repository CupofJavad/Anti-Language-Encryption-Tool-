Are you one of those seeking you know not what? In that case 
you are hungry and will be filled, but you will know not for what 
you hunger. Mind, friend, for this your hunger for something 
really comes from the soul

Norea, to be alive demands a systematic understanding of truth, 
and a systematic training, and as such Life becomes a science

What you call existence is not life. You need no more of it, Norea. 
We will give you death or we will give you life that is not mockery.  
But now, you need to get sick unto death of the illusions and glamour 
of the material world

We give you these words. When you fear, speak your words of power, 
fall back upon the infinite, through the light of your soul, and you will 
accomplish. Breath, Norea, you have just time traveled
