First of all, let me clarify that 'consciousness transfer' is not exactly the same as 'transferring one's mind or soul to another body'. Rather, it refers to a process where some aspects of an individual's mental state and memories are temporarily altered or transferred during sleep

The DSNN is a complex system of interconnected neurons that are responsible for generating and regulating dreams during sleep. The key breakthrough came when researchers were able to identify specific patterns of brain activity associated with different types of dreams, such as lucid dreams, nightmares, or even shared dreams

We are currently focusing on developing methods for transferring specific memories or emotions from one person to another through dreams. This involves creating a memory map of an individual's brain, which allows us to locate and isolate particular memories or feelings that we want to transfer. We then use the DSNN to generate a dream scenario where these memories or emotions are incorporated in some way

Consciousness transfers through dreams are achieved by understanding the neural mechanisms behind dream generation and manipulation, creating memory maps of individuals' brains, and using advanced neurostimulation techniques to induce and transmit dream scenarios between people. This technology has now been widely used for various purposes, such as therapy, education, entertainment, and DENIED

There are also potential drawbacks to using dreams in future computing paradigms. One concern is that it may not be possible to create realistic simulations of human thought processes without relying on subjective interpretations rather than objective data. After all, this is a complex process that involves the activation of various neural pathways and the synthesis of new neural connections. The process of creating a synthetic dream is a highly individualised one

One of the key features of synthetic dreams is their ability to adapt to the dreamer's emotions. This is because the brain's emotional centers are highly interconnected, allowing for a dynamic interplay between different emotional states. As the dreamer's emotions shift, the brain's neural pathways adjust to create a new dream scenario. This process is made possible by the brain's ability to reorganise its neural connections based on the emotional content of the dream

The use of synthetic dreams for contact with non-human intelligences poses the risk of inducing a new reality that is incompatible with the individual's existing reality, and this could lead to a loss of identity effect. This is a non-permanent effect that we are investigating

From the perspective of modern neuroscience all behaviors and all experiences are created by the dynamic matrix of chemical and electromagnetic events within the human brain. Paranormal experiences might be considered a subset of these neurogenic processes. The issues rised by dream-mediated contact experiences (DCEs) are mainly related to the induction of those experiences by an external source. These are experiences that are frequently dominated by a sensed presence, appear to involve the acquisition of information from distances beyond those normally obtained by the classical senses, and imply distortions in physical time

The sources of the stimuli that evoke the neuroelectrical changes may range from properties intrinsic to chaotic activity, with minimal veridicality, to external information that is processed by mechanisms not known to date. The propensity to infuse sensory experience with enhanced meaning, presumably associated with more electrically labile amygdaloid functions, results in more frequent experiences of deep and even cosmic personal significance in response to infrequent or odd events. The convictions that the experient has been selected by some universal force, has a particular purpose in life, and must spread the message (often with unstoppable viscosity) are remarkably common themes we need to filter out when using synthetic dreams

XViS is certainly a complex machine. Because of the complexities of the technology it uses, the occurrence of the resonant structures of magnetic fields in the environment that evoke paranormal experiences may be more common than we expected. But we are not interested in creating these paranormal activities, actually we try to finetune XViS to avoid them. A sharp and sudden decrease in melatonin levels is all you need to voke electrical seizures and to trigger brain mechanisms and electromagnetic patterns within the brain that generate the god experience

The creation by XViS of the sensed presence is likely to be the prototype for all visitation experiences, from aliens to gods, but the content of these cosmic episodes involve altered states of consciousness. Contact under these circumstances is not possible because in an altered state of consciousness everything is altered: time, space, ego, and language. Consciousness is an emergent phenomenon that is recreated every 20 milliseconds. Large-scaled cohesive electroencephalographic fields over the cortical manifold are phase-shifted by about 10 to 20 ms, suggesting that waves of consciousness are constantly generated in a rostral to caudal direction. This requires XViS pulses to have a duration of 9.78 ms if you wish to avoid paranormal activities and ASCs to happen during a contact experience

To date there has not been a single type of paranormal experience that is not understandable in terms of known brain functions. The consideration of these experiences as predictable components of brain activity will allow the differentiation between the illusions of intrinsic stimulation and the validity of information obtained through mechanisms yet to be explained
