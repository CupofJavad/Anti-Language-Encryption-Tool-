The strong anomalies in the Deneb Algedi star system are clearly based on the thought that any civilization undertaking astronomy would soon discover them. If owners of the probes reached to the conclusion that, sometime in the future, intelligent life would emerge on Sol-3, it is clear that choosing Deneb Algedi to position their probes is a good choice. The calculated distance to Deneb Algedi is 38.37 light years away from us, and the star is a variable type one. It brightness changes with a period that lasts for 1.0 day. As a beacon, Deneb Algedi is clearly a sound choice

We envisage a sufficiently advanced civilization able to tickle stars for signalling and communication purposes. The best approach would then be to use Cepheids as signalling devices. However, all biological life forms confront ontological crises, and in the particular case of Sol-3 we ignore what cognitive algorithms they use to solve the problems posed by our contact strategy. Contact between non-biological and biological civilizations do follow different rules of engagement than contact between two biological civilizations. Understanding this is crucial for any contact to succeed

Is it reasonable to expect that biological evolution had started from something equivalent in complexity to one nucleotide? Multicellular organisms have enough functional plasticity to produce a large variety of morphologies which are based on already existing molecular and cellular mechanisms. In our opinion, the origin of life, at least on Sol-3, was due to a gradual increase of functional complexity in evolving primordial systems that were already there. This was not a single lucky event
