After a period of observation, the orbs concluded that human society 
is clearly stratified. The orbs analyzed the interaction among humans  
and concluded those the interactions among individuals change at a rate 
enormously slower than the opinions of each of them. They also concluded that 
each individual human often chooses between his neighbors and decides which
 opinion to hold at a given time, according to his own
 advantage, based on the observation of what happens to his neighbourhood

The orbs concluded that human civilization state, at the time of 
observation, was a nearly decomposable system, that is, it is
at least partly built up of social units that are themselves unstable 
due to inequality and social stratification

Any good classifier knows that in the process of classification, information about
 variety is lost while information about similarities is gained. The utility of a 
classification must be judged (at least partially) by whether the quantity and quality of 
information gained outweighs that lost, and this depends largely on the purposes and 
needs of the analyst

but the analysis showed that, during the most devastating earthquake 
in California, dated DENIED 2023, the entire system collapsed due to its 
being under heavy social stress. The hierarchically managed networks 
of storage and redistribution of goods and produce vanished during the first 
three minutes of the earthquake. New social structures emerged to protect the privilege of a
limited few with preferential access to the scant resources

all cities were devastated after the DENIED event, and the environment turned 
highly toxic for them; orbs were sent in order to observe whether 
a new human civilization could emerge after the global collapse, and to 
gather data that could allow DENIED to simulate when and how such emergence
could be possible
