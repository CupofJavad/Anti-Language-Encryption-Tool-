The real observer always causes an unnecessary perturbation of some kind in the  phenomena under observation. The higher the number of observers, the stronger the  perturbation. Hence, observers maximize the quality of their observation by the  expedient of minimizing the number of competing observers. The game turns then  into a deadly game in which observers kill themselves until only one observer is  left. That's why there is just one God, and not many

when under observation, electrons are being  forced to behave like particles and not like waves. Thus the mere act  of observation affects the experimental findings. Thus, too, killing the observer  will allow you to recover the original behavior of the electron

Is there a rule that prevents discrete conscious states to be created except by stochastic choice? If so, this would mean the consciousness of an observer cannot exist simultaneously in more than one component of a superposition
