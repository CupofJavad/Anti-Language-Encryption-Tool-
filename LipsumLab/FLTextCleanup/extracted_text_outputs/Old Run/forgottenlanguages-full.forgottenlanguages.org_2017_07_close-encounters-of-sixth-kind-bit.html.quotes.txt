we distinguish a target searching by the mental body followed by a stabilization of the neuron ensembles, a process in which elementary acts of perception and consciousness are realized; then it comes a phase of entanglement between a number of similar elementary particles of both the entity and the human being via highly anisotropic nonlocal virtual guide bundles in which the double highly ordered conducting membranes of the coherent nerve cells provide the cumulative Casimir effect. After this phase, time as we know it comes to a stop. Now both the entity and you are tuned in, and information exchange takes place

The CAFB exchange took place under controlled conditions, inside the XViS tunnel. The walls of the tunnel are equipped with all kind of sensors and particle detectors, therefore we were able to monitor the entire environment and to measure the radiation levels during the encounter. For what we learnt, vacuum behaves like a truly polarizable dielectric which has the effect of reducing all charges by a constant amount. All the effects and disturbances that we recorded were due to the appearance of domains, that is, of bubbles or plumes in which vacuum polarization is substantially enhanced. This has the effect of reducing the charge of electrons and, consequently, the chemical bond strengths

a special self-organization process takes place in the brain during the exchange. The brain becomes correlated and therefore its entropy decreases, that is, order is created, at the expense of increasing disorder in the vivinity of the brain which manifests in all kind of weird physical disturbances in the environment. What we observe is a repulsive version of the Casimir effect which pushes objects away; we observe the burning of materials, failures of electric equipments, rapping noises and sudden movements of objects around the subject. For the untrained witness, the entire process is just like a demonic possession, a horrible experience, but for us is just the witnessing of a complex physical process that we call vacuum polarization enhancement

There is a signal recognition system in the weapon that responds only to a single, very specific, complex signal. But this holds as long as the weapon is working correctly. We are here talking about a weapon which is exposed to a weird spectrum of complex physical processes, processes that are created within the brain of a human subject which, in turn, does not behave anymore as a 'normal' 'standard' human, Sir. So yes, these subjects pose a threat to your
permissive action link
system, if that's what you want to know. A slow increase in pressure that puts strengths on the objects without originating any burst is the consequence of a weakening in molecular bond energies, and this in turn is an effect of the vacuum polarization enhancement

- What happens to these guys after the experience?
- They all die, Sir.
- But you talked about promising ways to avoid this, didn't you?
- I did, yes. We are now using people with varying specific neural configurations.
- Can you be more specific, please?
- We are experimenting with autistic individuals, Sir.
- Is that legal?
- It is as legal as you using autistic individuals to memorize thousands of digital codes for the PAL system, instead of storing those codes in hard disks, Sir. Giving them medical treatment and psychological support and providing them with welfare and social security benefits for them and their families does not make it ethical either
