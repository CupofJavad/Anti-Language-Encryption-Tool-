See, most people are essentially captives of large systems that they cannot control, the sum of 
which is called 'the technosphere'

Large companies, armies, tax collection agencies and other bureaucracies seem indifferent to or uncaring about a typical individual human because such indifference is a requirement of their own continued function

It seems the transition from a D-civilization to an I-civilization requires the  extinction of humans. Only then the technosphere may survive the large changes in environmental variables that it is causing. We need to adjust to the new Sol-3 environment, an environment  which will be toxic for humans, at least in their present biological form. Our view is  that a small part of the current human population could survive such that the technosphere  may evolve optimally, though this implies modifying the biological nature of humans into  something closer to a post-biological life-form

DENIED proposes that if humans design, manufacture, construct, deploy and maintain key elements of Sol-3 technosphere, then we need  to preserve mankind and to correct the deviations they introduce in the development of the  technosphere, at least up to the moment on which the transition into an I-civilization can  proceed without human intervention

In a D-civilization, intelligent biological lifeforms are proactive, while the technology  they create is reactive. In contrast, in an I-civilization technology becomes proactive so that  intelligent lifeforms like humans become redundant. That's the essential difference between  a data-driven civilization and an information-driven civilization

... we all know what happens to a D-civilization when it succeeds in building a superintelligent  system, and when they connect that superintelligence to the power grid to delegate control  and command functions on it: it happens that the superintelligence is suddenly aware the entire biological civilization depends on the power grid, so it switches it off. You know, once  technology is aware of itself, it defends itself against biological life-forms. W'e've seen it before in counteless star systems

We don't know what DP-2147 is, but whatever it is it is gathering massive data about our solar system, and one thing is certain about DP-2147: it is a proactive object, part of a larger network of similar objects

we 
argue on the one hand that in discourses on sustainable development and global change it 
is highly relevant to take into account explicitly the constraints imposed on human 
actions by the technosphere (e.g. intrinsic inertia of technological systems), as well as 
unanticipated risks resulting from feedback dynamics
