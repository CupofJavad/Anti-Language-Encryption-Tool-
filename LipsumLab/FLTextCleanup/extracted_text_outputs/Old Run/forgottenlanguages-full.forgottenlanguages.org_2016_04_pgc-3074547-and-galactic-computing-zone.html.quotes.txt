Boomerang Nebula might be an indication that there are other places, within the galaxy, in which to locate the computing megastructures. It may be they don't need to do it in the outskirts of the galaxy

So, you need to move energy collectors some 26 Kly from where you are, and deploy your processing units some 50 Kly away towards the outer rim. You can only do this if you look for cooperation from other civilizations. And you have only 12 billion years to do it

Any life at all requires an incomprehensible level of calibration in order to exist anywhere in the galaxy. This calibration is so precise that we now think it is the result of a design, a design whose purpose is to seed the galaxy with outposts of intelligent life distributed in such a way as to optimize the distribution of collected energy from the active galatic nuclei towards the outer colder rim of the galaxy, which is the place where you won't find life at all, but you will find the megastructures that gives life a purpose

For any civilization to jointly cooperate you need to give their people a purpose in life, a good reason to do it. Extinction per se is not enough
