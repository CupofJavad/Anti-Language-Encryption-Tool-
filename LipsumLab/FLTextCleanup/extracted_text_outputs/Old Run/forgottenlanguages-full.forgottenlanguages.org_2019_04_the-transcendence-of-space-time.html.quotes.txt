Time is the longest distance between two places

Imagine a world in which there is no time. Only images

In a dream, events are triggered by other events, not by time


In a world without future, each moment is the end of the world

the experimentation carried out at XViS has to do with what is happening in the minds of the subjects 
when exposed to extra sensory perception experiments and experiments that trigger altered states of consciousness. 
The subjects under investigation at the Lyell Avenue Lab do all enter into psychic experiences that are 
thoroughly recorded and utterly analyzed. What seems to happen during 
these time is that the subjects relax their critical faculties and allows a dream-like state 
to pervade their mind. It is under these circumstances that synthetic dreams are injected and the subject's 
response recorded

A series of experiments focused on the use of music as a means of psychic communication and on the 
communication of telepathic signals via acoustical material and its effect upon the listener. 
We found that family pairings and especially friendships could be viewed as a
strong factor in ESP enhancement where extra sensory communication may be
 important. This may be due to the fact that in a non-psychical scenario such pairings 
are more accustomed to communication with each other

Psi is apparently not a human ability, though this doesn't mean that paranormal phenomena do not exist. 
What happens is that paranormal phenomena may result from motivations
or intentions that are not associated with identifiable living beings. We call these information 
systems 'exotic logic systems' -  ELS - and the main motivation of our research program 
is to try to understand how to exchange information with an ELS

The indication for at least the positive trials could be that telepathic communication was responsible for the 
correlation between the imagery expressed and the music sent

Perception of and response to environmental factors are basic
information processing capabilities of living organisms

Evidence that allegedly paranormal phenomena do not
conform to the usual assumptions for experimental research does not mean
that paranormal phenomena never occur. Different research paradigms,
strategies, and methods may be needed, and today XViS provides such a framework
for the research on these topics
