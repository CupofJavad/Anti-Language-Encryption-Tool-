By assuming that the facts about an event thousands of years ago should be treated on an equal basis with the evidence about a new event today, collected with our most advanced equipment, is to completely undermine the entire process of scientific inquiry. Yulara event is a full documented NTT type of event, to the most of our current capabilities. Our own personal beliefs are irrelevant. What matters is the reality around us and to be able to discern whether that reality has been tweaked or tampered somehow

to note the ample dark side of technological evolution is simply to re-state the problem that any honest science, and any honest religion, must both confront: the problem of evil.
