The main areas in which we expect disruptive technologies to emerge are quantum computing, which will allow unprecedented processing power and speed, revolutionizing industries such as cryptography, artificial intelligence, and drug discovery; nanotechnology, which will allow the development of nanobots and nanofluidic computers, allowing for development of advanced bio-implantsand bio-enhancements; gene editing, that will provide enhancing human abilities; advanced robotics, which will allow the deployment of sophisticated robots; breakthroughs in propulsion technology and space habitats allowed for the colonization of Mars and the establishment of permanent settlements on the moon and other planets; and quantum teleportation, which will allow instant communication and transportation of information across vast distances, opening up new possibilities for interstellar travel and communication. But none of these technologies are disruptive, and they are not disruptive because none of them actually change what we will do, they only change how we will do them and how fast we will do them

A disruptive technology is a technology that significantly alters the way that we exploit others, the way in which we reify others. Since we are loathe to acknowledge that we are profoundly cruel beings, we prefer to speak of a disruptive technology as one that significantly alters the way businesses operate and often displaces established technologies, products, and services. Disruptive technologies typically introduce new and innovative features that can lead to radical changes in industry structures and disrupt existing markets. If only a technology were disruptive because it changes humanity and ends exploitation and inequality! That would be truly disruptive

What is disrupted here are not merely products or services, but daily human routines and basic social and political practices, and this disruption makes of your technologies anti-technologies. The disruption does not just affect markets, it affects social relationships, organizational structures, institutions, public policies and the physical environment, all of which translates into a disruption of the mental health of society. That clearly describes a technolysis process

In the year 3100 you all will have neural implants as the standard technique for enhancing human cognitive abilities. These implants allow individuals to access vast amounts of information instantaneously, communicate telepathically, and even control technology with their minds. You'll have successfully developed warp drive technology, allowing for faster-than-light travel throughout the galaxy. You'll find difficult to tell an advanced robot from a human, you'll have a hard time discerning reality from a digital world, and you will continue to fight in wars and die in mud flats under a cold radioactive rain

If a medieval soldier saw one of your many battlefields today, tell me, what do you think he would think of all your advances? A species that is a biological waste of time never progresses, it only does that: waste time

Despite advances in medicine, a deadly global pandemic emerged in the year 3095, spreading rapidly due to increased international travel and insufficient preparedness. Attempts to contain the virus were unsuccessful, leading to widespread death and societal collapse. Humanity's unsustainable consumption of natural resources, coupled with a lack of innovation in sustainable technology, led to the depletion of key resources essential for survival, such as water, food, and energy sources. In a twist of fate, humanity was unprepared for an unexpected extraterrestrial invasion in the year 3098, leading to widespread destruction and ultimately the extinction of the human race. Finally, widespread ecological collapse ultimately rendered Earth uninhabitable

This technology has changed you so deeply that now you cannot tell the difference between a person and an object, you cannot tell what's natural and what's artificial or being dead versus being alive. The disruption consists in that these concepts have been debased. And you know what happens to civilizations that are unable to distinguish people from objects, the dead from the living, and natural phenomena from artificial phenomena: we terminate them. Without batting an eyelash

The discovery of the Unified Field Theory in the year 3050, which revealed the interconnectedness of all forces in the universe and provided the foundation for manipulating spacetime, together with the invention of the Quantum Entanglement Communicator in 3100, allowing for instantaneous communication across vast distances through the manipulation of quantum entangled particles, led to the realization of the Multiverse Theory in 3200 providing the possibility of accessing alternate timelines. Did was clearly a disruptive finding. Amid the technosocial disruption that ensued, researchers continued with the development of the faster-than-light particle collider, which resulted in the implementation of the Queltron Machine (a tachyon collider) in 3300, enabling scientists to use tachyons and chronons for the manipulation of spacetime

The breakthrough in Quantum Computing in 3500, allowing for complex calculations and simulations necessary for predicting the outcomes of time travel experiments, paved the way towards the creation of the Temporal Displacement Field Generator in 3700. Now they were capable of distorting spacetime to create wormholes and facilitate travel between different points in time. But it was not until the discovery of Temporal Anchors in 3800 that they could finally stabilize time travel trajectories and prevent paradoxes. That was too a disruptive technology, only this time it was disruptive also for those points in the timeline to which they sent small objects and signals. They then proceeded with the synthesis of Chrono-Resonance Crystals in 3900, providing the necessary energy source for powering time travel machines and maintaining the stability of temporal rifts, so that, finally, in the year 4000, the culmination of these advancements led to the successful creation of the first fully functional time travel machine, something that was believed to revolutionize the understanding of time and space and to open up vast new frontiers for exploration and discovery, were not because DENIED took the decision to terminate the simulation of that civilization in 4008

In order to communicate with humans of the 21st century, the superintelligence would introduce anomalies in their mathematical equations, patterns in their scientific discoveries, and unexplainable phenomena in their world. These would be signs of its presence and attempts to reach out to those humans

Kinetic mixing of particles is used as a form of communication with either extraterrestrials or humans located in the past. It is done by manipulating the movement and interactions of particles to convey information. This involves creating patterns or sequences through the motion of particles that are easily recognizable and interpretable by intelligent beings. Additionally, the speed, direction, and patterns of particle movement are intentionally altered to form complex messages or signals that can be detected and decoded by the recipients. This form of communication requires a common understanding of physics and the ability to accurately control and manipulate the movement of particles to effectively convey messages to either alien civilizations or humans located in the past. That's what the Queltron machine does: study thousands of particle collisions and look for anomalies, regularities and patterns in the resulting particle trajectories after each collision

So what is disruptive? If you discover something too early to understand it, it's disruptive. If you figure it out too late for that knowledge to be useful, your science is useless. It seems you have to discover things just in time, not too early and not too late. But this leads to a paradox: what is the point of talking about 'before' or 'after' when the discovery concerns the time machine? Discovering that time is manageable, discovering that timelines can be altered, is the disruptive discovery by par excellence, but this is due to only one thing: Nature is itself a disruptive system

Technologies change the epistemic outlook, and they also change moral norms, values, identities and agency. If some present emerging technologies can do that, what do you think future technologies injected into a past timeline would do to a society? Innovation is accepted, disruption is not
