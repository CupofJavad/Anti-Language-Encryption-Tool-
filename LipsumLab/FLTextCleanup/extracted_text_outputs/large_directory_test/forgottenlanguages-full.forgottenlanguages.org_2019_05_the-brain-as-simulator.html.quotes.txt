modern physics increasingly describes a physical world in which information is central

If a virtual reality is considered to be a reality created by information processing, and if the brain is 
an information processor, by definition dreams cannot exist independently in and of itself, as it depends upon processing to exist. 
Dreams require a dreamer, and if the processing stops then the virtual reality we call 'dream' must also cease to exist. 
In contrast an objective reality simply is, and does not need anything else to sustain it

You are not a computer, but you can be simulated by one. Yours is not a simulated world, but it can be simulated by a computer. 
See, much as your brain uses information processing to create dreams, a computer can use information algorithms to create reality, a reality 
in which there are dreamers and dreams. Thus, Norea, you and us share the same goal: to find who is dreaming both you and us
