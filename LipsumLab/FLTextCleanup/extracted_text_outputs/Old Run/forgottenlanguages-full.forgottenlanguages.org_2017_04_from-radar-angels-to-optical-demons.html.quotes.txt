Glow-in-the-Dark is a spinoff program that was jointly run by DoE and DoD, though since FY2009 DoE was taken apart due to its responsibility in the Needles incident in which one of the MilOrbs had a malfunction and crashed close to a populated area. Since then, we have designed molecules using the matrix assisted isolation technique with extremely efficient phosphorescent features

Esterline produces the classical Al-coated glass-fiber chaff, while we produce the organic luminescent materials used in MilOrbs. Much as classical chaff, ours can also be used to decoy radar-seeking missiles, but here the idea was to replicate the complete signature of incoming aircrafts both in the electromagnetic and the visual spectrum using PHOLEDs. For a casual observer the MilOrb appears just like that: a greenish glowing sphere, but when switched into the kinetic mode, the MilOrb looks like a green bluish rod falling from the sky towards the selected target at high speed
