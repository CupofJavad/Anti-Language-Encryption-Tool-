The mission profile defines a transect for Sol-3 allowing a comprehensive exploration of the planet's natural and man-made environments, gathering data and information for analysis and understanding. The transect also includes investigating human-made structures and infrastructure to understand the impact of humanity on the environment. The orbs will monitor pollution levels, deforestation, urban sprawl, and other environmental issues. This involves mapping out and studying various ecosystems and landscapes on Sol-3

The orbs are programmed to fly in a coordinated formation, scanning and sensing different regions of Sol-3 from the sky. They travel over forests, deserts, mountains, oceans, and urban areas, gathering data to analyze and study the Sol-3's diversity and interconnectedness

Landing sites are selected as follows: 1. Amazon Rainforest, at DENIED. Motivation: A diverse and largely unexplored ecosystem with a rich variety of plant and animal species. 2. The Great Barrier Reef, at DENIED. Motivation: The largest coral reef system in the world, home to a wide range of marine life and unique underwater habitats. 3. The Sahara Desert, at sites DENIED and DENIED. Motivation: The largest hot desert in Sol-3, with stretches of arid landscapes and extreme temperatures, providing a stark contrast to other landing sites on Sol-3

Three military mission profiles were defined. They allow a systematic transect over US military facilities to gather intelligence and assess their defensive capabilities. The orbs are required to collect data on the layout, infrastructure, and activity at each facility. The orbs will fly in a grid pattern, covering the entire area of the military facility. Any hidden or underground structures will be sensed. Throughout the transect, the orbs communicate with each other and with DENIED, relaying real-time information and coordinating their movements to avoid detection. They are programmed to prioritize collecting data on strategic points such as command centers, weapon storage facilities, and communication hubs. After completing the transect, the orbs will return to the designated rendezvous point at DENIED, where they will upload the collected data to DENIED for analysis. For each military facility a vulnerability assessment is performed and potential targets for future missions will be defined

... reporting sightings of UAPs in Zhuhai Air Base, Yulin Naval Base, Lhasa Air Base, Shenyang Aircraft Corporation facilities, and Force's 51 Base. Simultaneous sightings were reported over Khmeimim Air Base and Latakia Naval Base (Syria), as wells as the Moscow Military District, Severomorsk Naval Base, and the Vostochny Cosmodrome

... as we expect to face an scenario based on a multi-faceted attack plan according to which on the first 6 hours a surprise cyber attack on Sol-3's communication and power grids is launched, disrupting the ability to coordinate a response. The following 3 hours a combination of ground and airborne forces would target key strategic locations such as military bases, government buildings, and population centers destroying vital resources. It is during the last 4 hours of the attack that we expect them to devastate any remaining infrastructure both on ground and on space

During MilOrb-1440 tests, the orb approached the human driving the car by silently hovering above the vehicle, observing their actions and reactions. It took note of the human's physical appearance, his movements, and his facial expressions in order to try and understand his behavior. It also analyzed the human's driving skills, noting how he navigated the dark and deserted road, the use of lights and signals, and his reactions to unexpected obstacles or challenges. The orb was tasked with gaining an understanding of the human's decision-making process and how humans respond to different stimuli while driving. Additionally, DENIED sensors were used to scan the human's brain activity and body language, trying to decipher his thoughts and emotions as he navigated the road. Finally, the orb took note of any communication devices the driver may be using, such as a phone or GPS, to further understand human's interaction with technology while driving. Note that the entire test was non-intrusive and objective. The driver never knew he was being observed by the orb

Test number 732 was performed using a MilOrb-1057. The test was run at DENIED location, in Mauritania. The orb approached the solitary human herding goats in a deserted place in a gentle and non-threatening manner. It moved slowly towards the human, emitting a soft, glowing light to catch his attention. Once close enough, it subtly altered the frequency of the light emissions to communicate with the human on a DENIED level. Images were projected trying to induce in him emotions to convey peaceful intentions and curiosity. When the human showed symtomps of high distress and fear, the light emissions from the orb suddenly ceased and the orb left the area, as expected

This research allows us to compare the logic of our orbs compared to theirs. We focus on the relationship between conscious intention and orbs. That non-terrestrial orbs follow similar transects means their mission profiles are similar to ours, hence we conclude they are exactly what MilOrbs are, only they are not man-made. We are not interested in the transcendental features of these objects; we are interested in the cognitive features

... these orbs are 7 meters in diameter, and the estimated velocity is 50 Km/sec. Now, we know a technology has been developed for drawing complex objects in three-dimensional space using balls of plasma as pixels. But as far as I know containment of plasmas by magnetic fields under atmospheric conditions would likely not last more than a second or two. Thus, I think MilOrbs are created and maintained by a new technology which may even be based on a new physics

... a sphere made of DENIED metamaterial, covered with a metasurface faceted with ultrasensitive nanoscale detectors able to detect any arbitrary frequency. They can recognize the electromagnetic environment around them and adaptively control of EM waves. All features of the detected EM environment induce a permanent specific alteration of the metasurface structure. Once recovered, the metasurface is analyzed and the recorded EM signals can be recovered. You won't see a receiver, a transmitter, antennas, or any old-tech hardware. See, there is no hw at all. An orb is just that: a sphere made of DENIED and covered with a metasurface aimed at mapping great areas. As for its propulsion, GNC, and other features DENIED..

DENIED is a medium-scale neurostrike weapon. Neurostrike is a military term defined as the engineered targeting of the brains of military personnel or civilians using nonkinetic technology. It is part of the brain warfare weapons program, which is in turn a spinoff of the neuro-cognitive warfare program. Cognitive warfare draws its essence from the innate neurobiological vulnerability of the human brain found within the CNS, the otolithic and vestibular systems, and vestiges of exploitable neural networks and synapses embedded in our bodies

We can infer from these observations that a technology has been developed for mapping our entire planet, and that technology is being actively used. The patterns we observe reflect a mix of classical mappping logic and an exotic logic we cannot understand. It seems to us it is not a question of purely mapping the technosphere, rather it is a question of whether what's being mapped is the emergence of a technosphere

The control issue is what is connected to human agency. I have called it the ‘anthropocenic illusion.’ It is the anthropocenic illusion that has been destroyed by the technosphere. There was the anthropocentric position of the human that gave him most of the agency (he was the model subject), the human subject was the only one having real agency. The interesting thing is that this construction caused a lot of technological progress and brought us into a situation where exactly this kind of proscription to the human turned out to be an illusion

The Earth is an object to be managed. Sensing is a tool for doing that, and sensing has come down from outer space to the ground, and is now distributed through multiple different environments. There are so many layers of technological systems operating on us than we shouldn't worry about having one more layer: the non-terrestrial orbs. The mistake is to think that it is something we control. We don't. They do
