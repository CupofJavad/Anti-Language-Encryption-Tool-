Language is a way of categorizing reality so as to be able to talk about our experiences. It is through language that we exchange ideas about reality, and it is by virtue of language that we can share experiences. However, dreamland is a place where language itself dilutes and becomes inconsistent. This explains why it is so difficult for people to fully describe their dreams. Anyone trying to communicate a dream knows how frustrating this task is. We need a more effective language, a pictorial figurative sensory language that could take over and reflect our feeling states while in dreamland

We have been researching on consensual dreaming for at least 25 years now. This is a little known and highly secretive area of research that we always disguise as lucid dreaming research to avoid attention from outsiders. The main problem we face right now is that though there is no way out of the dream, except through the termination of the dream, in consensual dreaming you need to perform a synchronized dream termination because we are not dealing with just one dreamer but three. Synched dream termination - SDT - is the most delicate phase of the consensual dream protocol

Remote viewing belongs to the past. It never really worked because it didn't take into consideration dream states. Consensual dreaming, on the other hand, is currently our only chance. Consensual dreamers provide us with a view that reflects back the imagery developed within the shared dream. You need tools and methods to decode that view into useful information, which is what XViS provides. Having three people to dream of the one same dream is done via DENIED protocols. Once the dream is terminated the dreamers go through the reporting stage, and we finally assemble the data gathered

XViS program is meant to pick up information about events that are spatially distant, and events that are happening right now in our future. It is a time probe
