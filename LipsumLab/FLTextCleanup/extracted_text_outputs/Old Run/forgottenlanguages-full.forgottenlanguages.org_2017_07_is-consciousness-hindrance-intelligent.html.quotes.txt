Consciousness is just that, a secondary byproduct of evolution. Certainly, consciousness is overvalued, and only those who are conscious value it as much as a snake values its infrared vision

the laws of physics don’t forbid interstellar travel, but they don’t make it easy if you are a conscious life form. Now, if you were a small rock, or just dust, or even a bacteria or a virus, interstellar travel would then be a natural happening for you

So, what happened to Giselians?  It happened to them that having learned all about themselves and their environment they had no desire to continue. In other words, they became conscious

Civilizations that are unaware of the existential peril of unconstrained growth will stagnate, and eventually collapse. Those who do not grow will also collapse

We agree that
the universal cause of the death of civilizations is the loss of knowledge functions, the loss of the capability to learn new things, yet ants have not learned a single new thing since 92 million years. They discovered ultraviolet vision, and that has been enough for them during all this time

as a species, language is what makes you human. And you wish to communicate with those other life forms using 'language', as if they were humans, too. And you look for life in exoplanets orbiting around a star like your Sun, obviating the fact that life forms can live on planets orbiting any type of star. See? You are not looking for extraterrestrials: you are just looking for humans. That's the solution to your childish Fermi Paradox
