Angels fell over the cities of the disk like birds of prey, Leaving behind scars of desolation, shattered dreams, and a grief-stricken landscape. No longer were the cities teeming with life, and they became the somber reminders of humanity's frailty under the relentless attack of celestial beasts. Their wings, once symbols of hope and salvation, now spread wide with feathers tipped in malevolence
