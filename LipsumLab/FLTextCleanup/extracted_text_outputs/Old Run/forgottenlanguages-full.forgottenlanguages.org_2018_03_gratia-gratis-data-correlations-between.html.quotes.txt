The deployment of spiritual weapons must match the belief system of the population being targeted. It is useless to set up a Marian apparition among the bedouins or the innuits, much as it is stupid to display MilOrbs over Israel. Simulating UFOs is just a market penetration job: you need to know whom to target. All in all UFOlogy is just that, marketing, so we need to implement pure market research strategies

In our opinion, global health threat strategies are better, cheaper, and easier to implement than spiritual warfare. Spiritual weapons are good to cause ethnic conflicts and to destabilize specific areas. A pandemia, on the other hand, is clearly more effective to control densely populated areas regardless of the belief systems acting on the targeted population. So far, Ebola is clearly seen as just an African problem. This perception is something that needs be changed
