... that the only really durable technology to signal your existence to other civilizations is to send orbs ahead in the chronal time line. Obviously, there would be future civilizations that won't understand what they are seeing; civilizations that will fear the orbs, civilizations that will mistify them, much as we mistify the ancient pyramids or the orbs themselves. But there will also be at least one civilization that will understand the message

initial hot spots in the beam profile self focus earlier during the propagation. You will then observe multiple filaments occuring closer to the focusing optic in a zone of larger diameter. ECM equipment detects the presence of longer chirped pulses such that the peak power is lower, hence multiple filaments occur nearer the geometrical focus where the diameter of the beam is smaller.In the end, a glowing color-changing orb materialises that moves slowly in mid air

All civilizations implode sooner or later. Life's all about dying. Building pyramids, palaces, etc. won't stop fade and dissolution. A neutrino beacon is a good option to signal the existence of a civilization, but even neutrino beacons cannot stand the test of time. An orb, traveling along a closed timelike curve would be a better way to do it

The Darwell Hypothesis can be formulated as the hypothesis that holds orbs and plasma-like phenomena are probes from a distant past, sent by a Type III civilization before their collapse. They travel along CTC lines and emerge at specific points in the worldline. The probes are the message, ready to be interpreted only by those sufficiently advanced civilizations that can manage the Planck energy
