the brilliant thing about USA 267 is that it is neither monostatic-radar-stealthy, nor optical-stealthy; you can see it in orbit, and track it. But to all effects it looks just like debris from a previous exploded satellite. You never realize that what you are seeing is precisely a fully working operational military satellite


USA 267 is a nightmare. You hide weapons or troop movements on the ground when you know a satellite is overhead. Non-stealth satellites can be tracked and their orbits can be predicted, and this allows you to plan in advance to avoid your movements and weapons to be detected. But you do not do that when you are confident that what it is overhead is just space debris. That is the key principle behind USA 267
