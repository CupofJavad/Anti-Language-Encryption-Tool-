Entropy is generally regarded as expressing the state of disorder of a physical system. More precisely, one can say that entropy measures the lack of information about the true structure of the system

Currently it is widely believed that the physical body (plus its brain) is the only organism that a human being possesses. However, this is not a necessary truth but only an a priori assumption. I suggest that phenomenal consciousness is also a highly organized and complex entity

there are at least two aspects to knowing what it is like to have a certain experience. One concerns what it is like to be the subject of an experience; another aspect concerns the ‘phenomenal’ or ‘qualitative’ character of the experience

we get a picture of a phenomenal consciousness as a spatially extended and material entity located outside the brain in a space of its own that is one cross-section of a higherdimensional space, of which another cross-section encompasses the physical world. The next step was contributed by H. H. Price (1953), who saw that these two entities must be connected by a new type of causal relation that connects events in parallel universes
