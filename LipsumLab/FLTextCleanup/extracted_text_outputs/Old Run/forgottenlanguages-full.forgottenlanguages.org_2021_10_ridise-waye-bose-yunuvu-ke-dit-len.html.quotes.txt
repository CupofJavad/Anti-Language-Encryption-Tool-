Look at the seething with processional eyes
it's wanted now
with pleasurelike services
Look at them all,
each one weeping
for a trust.
Look at the struggle with passionate eyes
it's gowned now
with dirty horses
Look at them all,
each one glimmering
for a gotten thing

As I am is chased by you,
while the sin is forgotten,
my eyes are unrelated
to whatever they see

They don't know it,
They don't learn.
Communication is always in whispers
Like glints in the dark

There is a dim beauty
in the unforgiveness of my separation,
it covers me
and sells my soul
