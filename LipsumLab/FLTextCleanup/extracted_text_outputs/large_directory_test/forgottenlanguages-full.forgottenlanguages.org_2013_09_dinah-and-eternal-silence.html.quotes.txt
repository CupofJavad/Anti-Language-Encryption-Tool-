Where language and naming are power, silence is oppression, is violence

Rape, we must remember, is a crime; women are the victims of it. Rape is not the just desert of any woman who dresses casually, goes out at night, or lives alone.

Rape victims have been treated as the guilty ones, the outcasts, for too long
