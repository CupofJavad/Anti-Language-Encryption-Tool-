the strucute seems to obtain its water via a pipeline from DENIED, which ends in what 
seems to be a cooling tower. One of the deep boreholes we performed (BH-12) allowed us 
to collect subocean soil samples. No organic vapors were detected by the DENIED remote vehicle

Concentrations from the sump outfall samples were extremely high, and radiation 
levels exceeded the operational capabilities of the DENIED remote vehicle. The vehicle was 
commanded to a secure location, some 200 m away from what we believed was the access ramp 
of the DENIED structure

Site-specific geology at DENIED site is solely based upon the soil and rock encountered 
during drilling of deep borehole BH-12, an operation that ended in disaster when the 
unidentified object destroyed the remote vehicle. That the incident took place exactly 
on the same day MSTI-3 was targeted by a chemical laser is just a coincidence

MSTI-3 main goal was  to resolve whether tracking theater ballistic missiles (TBMs) 
in the coast phase against a warm earth background is achievable. The official 
version we gave back then was that the satellite plashed down in the ocean, South of Hawaii. 
As you know, there were no reported sightings of any debris

Our tests focused on denial of use rather than absolute destruction of enemy satellites,
and that was the context of the 1997 test in which a laser temporarily blinded an Air Force 
MSTI-3 satellite at 300 miles altitude. We also destroyed USA-193, in 2008 using 
 a modified Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) fired from the Aegis-system-equipped USS 
 Lake Erie, and then, too, we experienced a similar encounter with DENIED beings
