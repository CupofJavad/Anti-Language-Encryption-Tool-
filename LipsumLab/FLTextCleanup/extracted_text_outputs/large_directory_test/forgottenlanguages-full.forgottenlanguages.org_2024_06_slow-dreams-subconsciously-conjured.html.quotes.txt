The combination of the induction technique paired with galantamine medication looks to indeed help trigger lucid dreams, and the higher dosage delivered a stronger result

Lucidity can arise during an ongoing dream (often through the recognition of a cue or an anomaly indicating that one is dreaming) or, less commonly, by maintaining awareness while transitioning directly from the waking state into a dream

galantamine was associated with increased recall, sensory vividness, bizarreness and complexity of dreams. Lucid dreams overall were associated with significantly higher levels of recall, cognitive clarity, control, positive emotion, sensory vividness and self-reflection on one’s thoughts and feelings compared to non-lucid dreams

In contrast to donepezil and rivastigmine, galantamine is not only an AChEI, but also a positive allosteric modulator of nicotinic ACh receptors. This property allows galantamine to potentiate the effects of ACh on these receptors, possibly enhancing its effectiveness in improving cognitive function
