Silencing the adverse effects of meditation makes no good to meditation at all. What about relaxation-induced anxiety and panic, paradoxical increases in tension, less motivation in life, plain boredom, even pain? What about impaired reality testing, confusion and disorientation? What about feeling 'spaced out'? What about depression, increased negativity, being more judgmental; and, ironically, feeling addicted to meditation? You don't want to hear about those adverse effects. You just think mediation is alright. You forget people have been alienated in your society up to the point to turn meditation into a product you can buy and consume

meditation and mindfulness are contraindicated there where you expect to find ego boundaries problems, which are the problems you find in people in modern societies. Who are the ones meditating, after all? Aren't they the employees with high salaries, reputable lawyers, rich, senior officials, all those who grease daily the machinery of misery? All your meditation industry is just that: a way to perpetuate injustice, a means to forget that one is an accomplice of the exploitation of the weakest ones
