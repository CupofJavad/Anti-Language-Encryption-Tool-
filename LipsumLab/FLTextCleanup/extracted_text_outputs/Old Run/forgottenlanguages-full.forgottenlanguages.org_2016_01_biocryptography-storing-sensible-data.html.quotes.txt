Action potentials that release calcium confer on plants the potential for computation, learning and memory and what we do is to exploit this complex mechanism. Plant cells have been proven to compute, remember and learn, through a Ca2+ based neural net system. What we've done is to implement a system to communicate with plants using photopulses which encode the information we wish to store and further retrieve
