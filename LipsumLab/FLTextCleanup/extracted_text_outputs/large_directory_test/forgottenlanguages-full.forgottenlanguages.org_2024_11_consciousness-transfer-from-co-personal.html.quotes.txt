If an individual consciousness can be defined, isolated, copied, and transferred, it will be from one mind to another to an artificial mind, and not to a biological mind. A machine can be designed to host consciousness, but a human brain is not designed to host consciousness other than its own

Assuming that our bodies are vehicles of a transcendent consciousness, it is appropriate to consider the nature of the vehicle. Putatively, biological vehicles of consciousness are products of evolution over many millions of years - adapted and refined to experience, enjoy and endure life on Earth

If the outer image of one can be somehow captured with fidelity and without deviations, so must be found a solution to do the same with his inner image; the process should be similar but requires using the right tools. Now, if consciousness can be copied rather than transferred, we could have several instances of the same consciousness existing simultaneously. Each copy would develop its own experiences and memories, leading to divergent streams of consciousness. This situation raises questions about which, if any, of these copies can be considered the true self

... and you all are mad scientists that believe spirits as conscious existence can enter and possess a body, leave it and reenter another one as a new hand into a glove, and making it move as the wandering spirit desires..

Neither bodily nor psychological continuity is either necessary or sufficient for our survival. Only phenomenal (or experiential) continuity is. So yes, you are dead, and yet here we are, having a conversation by this strange beach. Think of this: if individuals can exist in multiple forms or bodies, the traditional notions of family, friendship, and community might be fundamentally altered. People may form connections based on shared experiences rather than physical presence, leading to new forms of social interaction and emotional bonds. This is one of the reasons we will never accept consciousness transfer for your world

Each phase of your experience merges seamlessly with the next, and the next – indeed, so seamless is the flow that the division of experiences of this kind into distinct phases is often entirely arbitrary. Diachronic phenomenal connections of this sort are a pervasive feature of our streams of experience

Self and phenomenal continuity cannot come apart: all the experiences in a single, non-branching stream of consciousness are co-personal. If consciousness is transferred, how are memories and experiences integrated into the new stream of consciousness? Would the new self have access to the original's memories, or would it start anew? This impacts the continuity of personal identity and raises concerns about the psychological implications of such a transfer

He suggests that the combination of phenomenal continuity and psychological continuity is person preserving, and that physical continuity by itself is not. What experiments suggest is that selves and streams of consciousness cannot come apart
