) to take care of their own survival. In addition, their overall purpose is to sustain human life and its mission in extreme environments

Robots in this machine ecology would have a degree of functional specialization and autonomy that might increase with mission needs, and the robosphere would evolve

A sufficiently advanced self-adaptive robosphere would soon conclude that survival means annhilating a species that compete for the same resources: humans

For Colombano’s robosphere to be useful in planetary exploration robots must be able to produce energy, and to deliver that energy to other robots; they must be capable of functional specialization, and they must pursue survival. This means we need to find a way for those robots to at least consider the possibility to commit suicide, before they destroy our noosphere
