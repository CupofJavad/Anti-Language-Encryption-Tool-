Norea, you cannot awake a dreamer and still pretend he is a dreamer once 
he opens his eyes, much as  you cannot dream and be awake at the same time.
 Worst: a dreamer cannot tell you he is dreaming, without he opening his eyes 
 and desroy the dream. Remember there are dreamers, there are dreams, and 
 there are those dreamed of

Imagination is the power that moulds mental forms, it is 
the builder of all forms in the mind realm. Death does not end all, for there 
is a Great Beyond. Yet, even in dreams, death cannot sweep away

We are Watchers, Norea, and all we do is to establish an equilibrium in all things 
and in order to receive the things of the soul we must give of the things of the soul

To-day you are building for future eternity by your 
present actions. You, and only you, determine your own destiny. You are 
therefore accountable for all, either for salvation or condemnation; by your own individual will, 
you construct your own fate.  And there is nothing we can do to help you, Norea, 
for it is in the nature of the Watchers to observe. Trust in your own power, rather than in ours

Understanding neither the finite nor the infinite, you know nothing of your
beginning, of your present nor of your future, Norea. You are just groping in the dark 
without a light to lead you in the right. And when we show you the light, you fear it. 
It is in this state that you come into contact with the different expressions of life we 
show you
