A three dimensional being would have difficulty describing four dimensional objects or events since he would have but a three dimensional vocabulary to call upon. The highly unusual and somewhat confusing language that Ezekiel used to describe what he saw might well be the result of the inadequacy of our language to describe hyperdimensional objects or events; in turn, Jehu's description of what he saw is more scientific and detailed, not because he spoke a different language, rather because he used mathematical terminology - albeit limited - to help in the description of events

Right, really, no joking, but the language of Sol-3 STO-2075 scientists describing quantum effects clearly resembles Ezekiel's when he tried to describe his arrival to DENIED. You may laugh at Ezekiel's childish description of wheels inside wheels and bright-blinding thrones, much as you can laugh at current description of D-branes and hyperdimensional space-time. You are today's Ezekiel, my friend

Norea, learn that all kingdoms have a law given and there are many kingdoms, for there is no space in the which there is no kingdom and there is no kingdom in the which there is no space, either a greater or a lesser kingdom. And unto every kingdom, Norea, is given a law and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions

To approach light speed or faster than light speed what is needed is
not
anti-gravity
but
anti-mass/inertia. Superluminal speed cannot be achieved until at least light speed is achieved

if the ship speed is many multiples of the speed of light, the duration in spacecraft time is the distance divided by the speed of light, and that determines the spacecraft time elapsed during the mission and the physical aging of the crew. Thus, even with an 80-year lifespan of the spacecraft crew, the crew could only reach, and return from, stars that are less than 40 light years distant from Earth. So for less-than-light speed (subluminal) travel, the limitation is the lifespan of the Earth-bound observers, while for greater-than-light speed (superluminal) travel, it is the lifespan of the spacecraft crew that is the limitation
