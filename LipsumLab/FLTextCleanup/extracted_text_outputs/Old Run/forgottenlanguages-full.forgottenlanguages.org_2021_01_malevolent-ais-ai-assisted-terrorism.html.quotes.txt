AI has multiple uses in a wide spectrum of fields. Counterterrorism is one of them, so it was a matter of time 
for us to develop decision support systems based on AI that would allow us to better manage our emergency 
prevention and remediation systems. DENIED is basically a command, control, and intelligence system designed to 
assess risks derived from terrorist attacks. The recent security breach allowed the attackers to gain access to 
DENIED source code, so it is trivial for them to re-engineer the code to come out with an AI system which does 
exactly the opposite: to design optimum terrorist attack scenarios. So yes, we are watching the beginning of a new 
era in which terrorist attacks will be designed with the assistance of poweful AI systems such as DENIED

The model simulates the decision processes and interactions of complex
government systems engaged in responding to and recovering from a particular
terrorist incident in order to learn from them and maximize the design of future terrorist attacks.
It explores scenarios by calculating the effects of a terrorist incident in terms of social impacts, 
economic costs, and organizational effectiveness for the first 24 hours and for the first 30 days, 
and it finally selects the scenario which maximizes the cost function from the point of view 
of the terrorist group

The system was set up to propose terrorist attacks that would simultaneously target banking and 
financial systems, households, critical medical services and industries, federal government facilities, 
telecommunications, and electric power systems, with the requirement to maximize both damage 
to the selected targets, and the number of casualties expected, all of it within a given range of cost 
incurred by the attackers

DENIED analysis most of the time concludes that, for a given scenario, it may 
become worthwhile to attack targets that it otherwise would not
make sense to attack from the standpoint of prioritization or cost-benefit analysis.
When the human designed attack diverges from that of DENIED, we often find DENIED's proposed 
solution is more efficient in terms of damage inflicted

It is not just a explode & forget action; see, after a terrorist bomb explodes mergency plans are activated as a first response
to the immediate needs of the affected population. Numerous organizations, public and
private, are involved, requiring immense efforts at coordination and cooperation. If the attackers proceed to jam 
and interfere those efforts the damage increases. This evidently requires from the attackers coordination and cooperation, 
which means modern day terrorism is a highly qualified task which effectively makes the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Domestic 
Preparedness Program useless

We know some of the terrorit attacks were just proxy events in order to assess FEMA vulnerabilities, and to gain 
a deep understanding on how materials and supplies are moved, the availability of personnel, and the effectiveness of
the agency's actions. They also have a deep knowledge of the decision-making processes
implemented by the Federal Reserve following catastrophic events. We also discovered they have accurate knowledge on 
garbage trucks routes and timetables, and that they plan to use city buses and garbage trucks as bomb carriers

Well, AI systems reach and exceed human level performance, hence the use of AI assisted terrorism was something 
we were expecting to happen sooner or later
