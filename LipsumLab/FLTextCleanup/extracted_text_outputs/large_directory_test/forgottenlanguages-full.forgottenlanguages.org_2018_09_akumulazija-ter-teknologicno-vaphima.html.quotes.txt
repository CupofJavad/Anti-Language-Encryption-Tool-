We needed to commodify the most elusive and intangible human quality: creativity. We knew dreams are the source of creativity, hence we set forth to commodify dreams. This has proven to be more difficult than we expected. The lesson learned is that commodification under technocapitalism is much more difficult than its counterparts in previous phases of capitalism

The objective of creative power is to create value. Creating value, however, is all about intangibles and it must fundamentally involve creativity in order to occur. The way for commodification to occur is to separate patents, decoded genetic data, formulas, or software code from those who contributed their creative power to make them happen
