When reason is obscured, the will grows weak and powerless and feels an aversion for effort, because reason does not enlighten it. Consequently the memory loses its deep notions, and the joyous confidence, and the repeated zealous intentions by which its confidence taught it to endure more easily the misery of waiting for its Beloved

All persons will fall away from you and forsake you, and no one will be willing to wander about with you in your distress and in your weakness

I counsel them that they spare nothing,
And that they set themselves
To persevere with longing in the storm
In spite of their fault-finders, Who are so bent on harming them
