PSVs are inherently indiscriminate during the post-strike theater as, by design, they consider a target anything surviving 
the first strike. The idea behind PSVs is that if they are launched it is as a very last resort and in order to guarantee the 
mutual self-destruction. In other wars, their operational goal is to guarantee that the war in which they are used is the last war. 
That's why they are classified under the so-called 'no-future wars'

According to the Treaty, states undertake not to place in orbit around the Earth any objects carrying
nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction, install
such weapons on celestial bodies, or station such weapons in outer space
in any other manner. However, PSVs and MilOrbs do not orbit the Earth, they carry no nuclear weapons, and they are 
launched from Earth, therefore the Treaty obviously does not apply. But the crux of the matter is this: once they are 
launched there will be no way to stop them and, if they succeed in their mission, there will be none left to complain 
about violation of any treaty whatsoever
