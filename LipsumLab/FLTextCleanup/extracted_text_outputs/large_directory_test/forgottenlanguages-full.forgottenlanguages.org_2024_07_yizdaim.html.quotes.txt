There is Heaven, and there is the abyss, Norea. They are both immense, too immense that your mind will not comprehend. But tell me: How big are you? If you are not bigger than the things that upset you today, Norea, you are small, indeed

Give then a thought for us,
Walking so miserably,
Wanting relief in the friendship of alien beings;
Do but remember us,
For once could in love agree.
Swallow your pride,
And please let us be
As we used to be

Have you ever felt the starry silence of eternity? Have you ever felt that there is no discharge in your long wars, nor balm for wounds, nor love’s security? Norea, be patient to the end, and you too shall sleep pillowed on heartsease and forget to weep
