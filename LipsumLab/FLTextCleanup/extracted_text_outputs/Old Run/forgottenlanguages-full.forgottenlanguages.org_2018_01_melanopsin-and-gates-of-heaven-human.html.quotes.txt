The word '
Buddha'
means an enlightened being. The enlightenment can be effected by exposing the being to a specific lightning environment, provided the being has the adequate photoreceptors or any other biological way to entrain photons of a very specific energy and frequency. We're not interested in Buddhism, you know, we are interested in knowing how one gets enlightened, and this from a purely physical point of view

Neurons emit ultraweak photons when stimulated by glutamate. These so-called biophotons can be made to act as communication signals if properly collected, routed, and amplified. Now, implanting bioluminescent photons within the eyes of the subject only resulted in an increase of phosphene generation and the subject reporting all kind of weird visions and hallucinations. The question is whether the blue beam projected from the object was able to somehow activate or transfer biophotons directly into the retina of the observer. If it was, that would explain the mechanism through which our friends are able to induce highly realistic visions on the witnesses
