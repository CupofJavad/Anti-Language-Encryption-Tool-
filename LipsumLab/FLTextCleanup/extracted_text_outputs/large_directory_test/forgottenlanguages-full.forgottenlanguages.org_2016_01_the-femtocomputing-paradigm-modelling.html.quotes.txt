Collapsing civilizations are complex systems that continued to grow beyond the limits of their energy budget. This would be true unless such civilization makes the effort to find an efficient mechanism of technological transition. Therefore, there is a limit to the unlimited growth of the technosphere unless we are able to find a new technology with which to build a new technosphere energetically more efficient and therefore sustainable. That is,
the crisis of noosphere would be a consequence of the high energy consumption of the technosphere
, and therefore the noosphere would inherit from technosphere this major flaw

if our civilization continues with a similar technology to current, the noosphere will store an amount of information equal to 4,295x10
12
. On that date the noosphere will consume a 66% of the overall electric power produced on Earth or equivalently the electrical energy produced by 990 nuclear power plants

Sol-3 has to face in the near future a technological transition which would result into a new computer architecture, one that would be sustainable in terms of energy consumption. Only then would Sol-3 be able to reach the technological singularity, and only then contact with them would be feasible. The question is whether humans will evolve ethically or not, for if they insist in being ethically retarded contact won't be the gift they expect. At all

if you want your civilization at some time to reach the singularity point you will have to change both the technology that currently sustains your noosphere, and to become an ethically advanced species. Both things you need to do. Not just the former. Learn this, and learn this forever
