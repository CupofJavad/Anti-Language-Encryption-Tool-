DOLYN uses advanced pattern recognition algorithms to identify anomalies or structures that deviate from established natural patterns. We initially developed DOLYN as a network of underwater sensors with the aim of detecting nuclear submarines. It is also used to craft and design our signals to mimic those of marine mammals to hide our own submarines from detection. It was later on when we coupled DOLYN data to LyAV to analyze all kind of signals and patterns. This is how we discovered those unexplained algorithmic marine phenomena

While it is impossible to attribute all unexplained oceanographic data variations solely to communication from extraterrestrial civilisations, certain findings have puzzled us. Of course, these phenomena could also be attributed to human activity or natural occurrences; however, they remain intriguing for further investigation. An algorithmic beach like DENIED, located in DENIED, is being thoroughly investigated. This remote beach can be reached only by air or sea

We were training LyAV to make it able to discern artificial from natural phenomena. The training involved using the DOLYN database of underwater biosignals and technosignals. But the evidence of ocean waves being used by an extraterrestrial civilisation to communicate with us came by chance. We realized there was a form of consistent, unexplained variations in oceanographic data. Scientists monitoring sea levels, currents, and wave patterns observed repeated anomalies that align with specific sequences or codes. These anomalies include sudden shifts in current speeds, abnormal wave forms, and uncharacteristic temperature fluctuations in previously constant regions

Theoretically, an advanced civilization could employ highly specialized robotic systems or nanotechnology devices to control and direct oceanic currents. These systems would utilize localized adjustments in pressure and temperature to effectuate desired changes in flow dynamics. In principle, using such mechanisms, complex patterns and symbols could be encoded into the movement of water currents. The size and scale of these current manipulations would depend on factors like distance, target location, and signal complexity. But in my view, we are not witnessing a form of communication; what we're witnessing is the evidence that the environment is algorithmically designed, that is, Nature is artificial

Using ocean waves, these civilizations can transmit complex messages through synchronized, targeted manipulations of underwater currents or acoustic signals. Synchronized, targeted manipulations of underwater currents can be achieved through various technical approaches

Our understanding of what is natural and what is artificial might need refinement over time. The more we learn about nature, the more artificial it looks. And by 'nature' I'm also talking about us as humans

There is no definitive way to prove that a series of numbers is truly random, as true randomness implies an absence of any pattern or predictability

Precise and accurate construction can be a key indicator of artificial design, as it is difficult for natural processes to create such exact measurements. Unusual or unlikely patterns or arrangements that do not occur naturally may indicate an artificial origin for a phenomenon

Axions might not seem like a natural choice for communication purposes at first glance due to their elusive nature, but they could potentially be used in innovative ways to facilitate interstellar communication. One way this could work is through exploiting the properties of axion-photon interactions
