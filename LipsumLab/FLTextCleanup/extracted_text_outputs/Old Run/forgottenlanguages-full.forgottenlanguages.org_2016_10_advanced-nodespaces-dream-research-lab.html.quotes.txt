While our physical brain is extended in three real dimensions, keep in mind that the brain is fundamentally wave functions, all of which are extended in five dimensions, allowing the brain to interact with corresponding structures in the 4-brane and 5-brane

We were able to build - actually, to grow via polymerization - synthetic microtubules which, like the microtubules that are found in a human brain, are cylindrical hexagonal lattice polymers consisting of the protein tubulin. We then implanted these synthetic microtubules into specific areas of the subject's brain. This setup allowed microtubules to regulate synapses in a very specific way allowing them to process information via entangled bit-like states of tubulin

Our ability to conjure up anything in our dream space, or to change our environment through an action of the mind, is a universal characteristic of dreams

It forms a network of synthetic microtubules with the potential to entangle with distant tubulins in other parts of the brain, more specifically with those implanted around the Wernicke area. This allowed to bring about the conscious realization of a selected group of inputs which were then combined generating the complex mechanism needed to use the Queltron Machine

First, you are communicating with life forms who dwell inside the 5-brane; second, their biology has nothing to do with ours, and we now think there is no biology at all in the 5-brane, anyway; third, you need to change your own biology for the communication to succeed, you need to be fitted with complex quantum biogadgets and we ignore whether in the end, after going through all those brain implants, our operators are still humans or not; and last, but not least, you need to build an extremely complex facility to establish contact with them through the tiny point at which the two branes meet; see, we don't fully understand the relation between changing tubulin configurations and mind states. The only thing we know is that there is no other active way to contact these beings, unless you are happy doing what you've always done: passively waiting for them to contact you in dreams

Your mind is composed of minds at a faster timescale. Each of these “voices in your head” is composed of minds to increasingly microscopic scales
