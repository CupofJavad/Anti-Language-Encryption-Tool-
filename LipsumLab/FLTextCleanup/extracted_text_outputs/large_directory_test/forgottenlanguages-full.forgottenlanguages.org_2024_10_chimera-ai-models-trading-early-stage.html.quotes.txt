Whispers had circulated within intelligence circles about a clandestine marketplace dubbed
The Forge
where shadowy figures peddle not weapons or drugs, but sentient code: deepfake generators capable of crafting hyper-realistic videos, sentiment manipulation engines designed to sway public opinion, and even fragments of experimental General Intelligence – the holy grail of artificial autonomy. This is not just about cybercrime; it threatens national security, social stability, and the very essence of truth itself

Analysts tracked the flow of cryptocurrency – Bitcoin, Monero, Zcash – funneling into obscure wallets linked to The Forge

STM Alpagu and Kargu tactical loitering and attack systems use machine learning algorithms to optimize target classification, tracking, and attack capabilities without the requirement for a GPS connection. Significant fragments of the code are on sale at the purple market for DENIED bitcoins, and you can also buy WD controllers for the Russian KUB-LA kamikaze drone, together with code related to advanced military systems such as the F-35 fighter jet

In a clandestine AI black market such as the purple market, certain models are highly sought after due to their unique capabilities and illicit potential. They include models such as DFGs, SMMEs, CB&ECs, WDs, ESFRs, BSAs, SMAIs, and in particular, the ESAGIFs or Early-Stage AGI Fragments

As a law enforcement agency we know challenges to policing and the criminal justice system today stem from technological development. Rising crime trends, especially cross-jurisdictional offending, have been conventionally ascribed to comparatively new and, from a global north perspective, inexpensive digital technologies. The black market for illicit AI models is new, but it is something we knew it could happen, but achieving the right level of engagement with the Police to undertake impactful and critical social science research is difficult

Each time someone introduces a paradigm-shifting technology there are unintended consequences that may pose existential threats, or create opportunities for crime that vary from the annoying to the catastrophic. Furthermore, there exist few regulations regarding AI crime and AI security

In an ideal world, legislation and regulations would be introduced prior to the sale of such AI models and it would be future-proofed to ensure that new models are developed to be secure by design. However, we do not live in an ideal world, do we? There are models you can buy in the purple market such as CB&ECs (Codebreaking & Encryption Crackers), and there are BDAs (Biometric Spoofing Algorithms), and you also find WDs, those weaponized drone controllers that sell for DENIED bitcoins at The Forge

Those who seek to exploit generative AI models for malicious purposes will likely find ways to circumvent solutions implemented to reduce the misuse of the technology. It takes one click and two transactions to buy a good virtual or fake kidnapping AI model at The Forge

In the black market of illicit high-tech, the so-called purple market, sort of a black market AI bazaar, early-stage AGI fragments are incredibly valuable, coveted for their potential and raw power, even if incomplete. Malicious actors don't necessarily need a fully functional AGI, but rather pieces of its core mechanisms. These fragments are dissected to unlock novel algorithms with the goal to decipher unique learning paradigms, reasoning processes, or data representation techniques employed by the AGI prototype. This stolen knowledge accelerates their own AI development, bypassing years of research

While GenAI poses threats today, the potential threats associated with quantum computing are more likely to materialise sometime in the future

In a recent operation conducted by DENIED individuals were apprehended, programmers, financiers, and even rogue researchers. Let me tell you that the operation was secret and not legally justified because it's difficult to explain to a judge what an ESAGIF is, and there's no law against trading AI code fragments. This is a messy situation because the digital world is complex and doesn't align with the ideal world that judges imagine we live in
