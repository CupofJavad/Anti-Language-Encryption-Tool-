Norea, when people cease believing in something, it is not that they believe in nothing; but that they then believe in anything

What, Norea? You thought angels always look like angels, with their glowing robes, halos, and wings? You will recognize angels only through their messages or deeds, and usually in retrospect. You will realize you have met today an angel, tomorrow

Tell us, Norea: does your desire give you a good reason to act? You should rely on natural reason rather than revelation. Now sleep, close the eyes you never really opened: at dawn you should have forgotten having met us in these plains
