The goal of population neuroscience is to understand how the brain is shaped by 
internal effects such as genes and from external factors such as the 
social and physical environment. Sadly enough, this science is clearly underdeveloped 
in Sol-3 and by the time humans start to understand its implications it will be too late

There is a growing tendency for humans to ignore the powerful effects that the 
environment can have on their brains and behavior. The stronger this tendency is, the further 
they are from achieving the necessary technological skills to explore the Universe

Humans are a social species and require social interactions to maintain 
positive physical and mental health. The no-contact strategy is an optimum one for most 
of Sol-3 development. However, there is a point in time at which prolonging such a no-contact 
strategy can produce in humans an unbearable feeling of cosmic loneliness the consequences of which, 
as we know, are always linked to self-destruction. In this scenario the question arises as to 
who is responsible for such a destruction. Early contact is as harmful as a late contact
