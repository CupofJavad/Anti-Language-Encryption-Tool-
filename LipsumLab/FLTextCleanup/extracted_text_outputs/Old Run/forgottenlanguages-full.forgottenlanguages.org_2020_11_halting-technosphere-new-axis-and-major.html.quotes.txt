At the end of the first stage, all state and military command and control systems, the economy, ICBMs, mobile based ICBMs, 
missiles on the flight trajectory, radar sites, spacecraft, and energy supply systems will be effectively destroyed. We expect 
power plants, substations, and transmission lines for entire cities or regions to be fried. The success relies on preventing  
the shut down of the world grid before it's struck

For the US region, the attack addresses an scenario targeting 68,992 electric substations , 3,200 control centers, 
13,617 microwave radio links, 8,750 fiber amplifiers, 4,570 radio base stations below 1GHz out of a total of 
51,954 radios at all frequencies, with a special emphasis on wiping out the 6 GHz and 11 GHz microwave radios, which 
are the most widely used by utilities

An EMP attack can be delivered anonymously. Launched off a freighter, a submarine, by jet, or by satellite 
 (hundreds of satellites are in low Earth orbit), the perpetrator of an EMP attack might never be identified.
EMP attack leaves no fingerprints

We know the technosphere is destined to collapse, so we need to anticipate for the collapse to be graceful 
so that it won't impact us more grievously than it has to.  Call it an orderly 'shutdown', the 'graceful dead of the 
technosphere', or simply 'the great reset'. Names are unimportant here. The important thing is tomorrow's 
survival of humanity by sacrificing today its technosphere
