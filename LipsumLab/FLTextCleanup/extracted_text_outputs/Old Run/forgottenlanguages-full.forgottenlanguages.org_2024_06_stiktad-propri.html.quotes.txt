If language, in its saying and naming, is basically a bringing to presence in consciousness, it is radi- cally impossible to “say” death, since consciousness is itself annihilated by death. What consciousness grasps is only some external effect of death, like a corpse, and never death itself as it is experienced from the inside because consciousness is no longer present at the moment of its own death
