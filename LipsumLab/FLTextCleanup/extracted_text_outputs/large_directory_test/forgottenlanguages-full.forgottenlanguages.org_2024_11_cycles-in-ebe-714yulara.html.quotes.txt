Sleep spindles are burstlike signals in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of the sleeping mammalian brain and electrical surface correlates of neuronal oscillations in thalamus. As one of the most inheritable sleep EEG signatures, sleep spindles probably reflect the strength and malleability of thalamocortical circuits that underlie individual cognitive profiles

In the fast lane of chronobiology, ultradian events are short-term rhythms that have been observed since the beginning of modern biology and were quantified about a century ago. They are ubiquitous in all biological systems and found in all organisms, from unicellular organisms to mammals, and from single cells to complex biological functions in multicellular animals. Since these events are aperiodic and last for a few minutes to a few hours, they are better classified as episodic ultradian events (EUEs). These short-term rhythms differ from the circarhythms in that they do not correspond with any known environmental periodicity

A biological rhythm is called ultradian if its period is shorter than 24 hour. Ultradian rhythms have been observed in physiological functions, like cellular processes, respiraton, circulation, hormonal release and sleep stages, as well as in behavioral functions, often related to feeding patterns. Ultradian rhythms are characterized by diversity not only in period length (from hours to milliseconds) but also in mechanisms and functions

Differences in neuroanatomy, environmental influences, evolutionary adaptations, and cognitive implications lead to a wide array of ultradian rhythms that contrast sharply with those of humans. Understanding these differences is crucial in appreciating the complexity of exo-biological systems

One of the most striking differences between human and exobiological brains lie in their neuroanatomy. Human brains are characterized by a complex structure, including the cerebral cortex, limbic system, and brainstem, which work together to regulate ultradian rhythms. In contrast, the brain of EBE-714/Yulara exhibits a radically different architecture, potentially featuring unique structures or neural pathways that influence the timing and nature of ultradian cycles

Our main hypothesis is that if an alien species evolved in a high-gravity environment, their brain might possess specialized regions that facilitate rapid neural processing to adapt to the physical demands of their surroundings. This could result in ultradian cycles that are shorter and more intense, reflecting a need for quick recovery and adaptation. Conversely, an alien species from a low-light environment might develop longer ultradian cycles, allowing for extended periods of rest and energy conservation. As we cannot communicate with the EBE, a way to know about its planet is to measure these cycles

Hypothetically, alien species may experience entirely different environmental cues that dictate their ultradian rhythms. For example, an alien species living on a planet with a longer day-night cycle might exhibit ultradian rhythms that are synchronized with their unique solar patterns, leading to cycles that differ markedly from the 90-120 minute cycles observed in humans

EBE-714/Yulara relies on a different set of neurotransmitters and hormones to regulate its biological cycles, which leads to entirely distinct patterns of activity and rest compared to humans

From our analysis, uncomplete and clearly preliminar, we would conclude EBE-714/Yulara developed in a predator-rich environment, whch would explain the ultradian cycles we observe, cycles that prioritize alertness and rapid response to threats. But this might be a gross extrapolation. First, EBE-714/Yulara is being analyzed in isolation, in an an environment which is not the one in which it developed. Second, we have no other organism to compare to

The differences in ultradian cycles between this exobiological entity and human brains have profound implications for cognition and behavior. In humans, ultradian rhythms are linked to cognitive performance, mood regulation, and overall well-being. That EBE-714/Yulara exhibits significantly different ultradian cycles may imply it experiences distinct cognitive patterns, such as variations in attention span, memory consolidation, and emotional regulation
