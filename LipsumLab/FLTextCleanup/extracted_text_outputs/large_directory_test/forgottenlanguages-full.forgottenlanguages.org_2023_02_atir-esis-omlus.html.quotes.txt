Even if it could be reached, we do not know if the object presents a biohazard. Exploring the object remotely with robotic probes would not be of much use either because, at that depth, the telemetry would not work properly

The destination of a time traveller is the realm of past objects. How real can be a past object and a future one? This concerns the ontological aspect of the tense/tenseless debate. There is an ontological problem of reality of things existing in time
