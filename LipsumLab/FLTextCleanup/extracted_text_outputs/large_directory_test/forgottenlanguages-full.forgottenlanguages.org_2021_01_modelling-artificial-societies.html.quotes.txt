we set to investigate whether all agents share the same behaviour or
whether they behave differently, in other words, representation of behaviour is either
individual or uniform. Another general aspect is the number of individuals modelled,
that is, the size of the model, which may vary from a few individuals to billions of
individuals

the mental state and the behaviour of individuals, when representing
human beings, is modelled using a feature vector combined with
a set of transitions rules, an approach which is often sufficient in order to simulate simple 
machines and animals, such s humans

It is a cause of sadness to humans realizing human society can be so easily simulated in a computer. This tells the story that humans, after all, are no more complex in their interactions than simpler animals

Education, in its truest sense, is not about a saleable skill set. It's 
 about freedom, from inherited prejudice and argument by authority. 
 This is the deepest contribution of the modeling enterprise. 
 It enforces habits of mind essential to freedom
