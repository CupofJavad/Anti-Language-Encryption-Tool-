If a small change is made that affects a long-term historical trend, 
then the effect of that change will almost always be transitory — the 
trend will soon revert to its original state

If a change is made that is sufficiently large to alter permanently a 
long-term historical trend, then it will alter the society as a whole. 
In other words, a society is a system in which all parts are 
interrelated, and you can’t permanently change any important part 
without changing all other parts as well

If a change is made that is large enough to alter permanently a 
long-term trend, then the consequences for the society as a whole cannot 
be predicted in advance. Unless various other societies have passed 
through the same change and have all experienced the same consequences, 
in which case one can predict on empirical grounds that another society 
that passes through the same change will be like to experience similar 
consequences

A new kind of society cannot be designed on paper. That is, you cannot 
plan out a new form of society in advance, then set it up and expect it 
to function as it was designed to do

People do not consciously and rationally choose the form of their 
society. Societies develop through processes of social evolution that 
are not under rational human control

People anxious to rescue freedom without sacrificing the supposed 
benefits of technology will suggest naive schemes for some new form of 
society that would reconcile freedom with technology. Apart from the 
fact that people who make such suggestions seldom propose any practical
means by which the new form of society could be set up in the first 
place, it is clear from simulations that even if the new form of society 
could be once established, it either would collapse or would give 
results very different from those expected
