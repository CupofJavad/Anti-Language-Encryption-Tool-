it is a matter of perspective whether the brain computes, processes information, is a classical system, or is a connectionist system. Different perspectives serve different purposes, and different purposes are legitimate. Hence, all sides of the foundational debates can be retained if appropriately qualified

Whether cognitive or neural events fulfill all or any of the job descriptions of computation and information processing is in part an empirical question and in part a conceptual one. It is a conceptual question insofar as we can mean different things by “information” and“computation” and insofar as there are conceptual relations between the various notions. It is an empirical question insofar as, once we fix the meanings with of “computation” and“information,” the extent to which computation and the processing of information are both instantiated in the brain depends on the empirical facts of the matter

The physical form of pancomputationalism is not directly relevant to theories of cognition because theories of cognition attempt to find out what distinguishes cognitionfrom other processes, not what it shares with everything else

A common misunderstanding of Shannon information is that it is a semantic notion. This misunderstanding is promoted by the fact that Shannon liberally referred to messages as carriers of Shannon information. But Shannon’s notion of message is not the usual one. In the standard sense, a message has semantic content or meaning, there is something it stands for. By contrast, Shannon’s messages need not have semantic content at all: they need not stand for anything
