It is irrelevant whether we are talking about esoteric or scientific knowledge. Both are just one and the same thing. And if there is a difference it is this: the practitioner of esotericism never sold his soul to the established powers, while the scientist is always on the payroll of the State

It is not about going against science; It is about going against scientists turned into technocrats, stupid beings that are an essential part of an unfair social system

In fact, all the brutality of the system resides in the passivity of those who witness oppression, without experiencing it. Fortunately, a natural catastrophe does not distinguish between oppressed and oppressors, which explains why the oppressed dream of asteroids that annihilate life as we know it

Vertical societies, in which some live at the expense of others, show all the geometry of what is irremediably self-destructive
