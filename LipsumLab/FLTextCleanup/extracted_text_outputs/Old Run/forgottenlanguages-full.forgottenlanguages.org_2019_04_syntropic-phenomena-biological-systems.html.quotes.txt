All thoughts, theories and mathematics that the
human mind can produce can be observed by the
observer. This means that the observer has the
highest degree of complexity, which is then
followed by mind in lower dimensional Hilbert
spaces

Consciousness can be viewed from the standpoint of
evolutionary biology as an adaptation in the
sense of a trait that increases fitness. Within this 
framework, consciousness allows living organisms to make
distinctions between appearance and reality, and this 
clearly means we do require conscious probes to explore 
Denebian probes. This calls for a manned exploration mission 
to DP-2147 as we lack the technology to confer consciousness 
to nuts and bolts probes. Yet, on the other hand, biological systems
- such as humans - are extremely unreliable eyewitnesses and you simply 
cannot trust them in a data gathering mission. In the end it seems 
a Denebian probe is designed to be only understood by another Denebian probe

The density of information
is correlated with intelligence, which means that
consciousness as the n-dimensional Hilbert space
is of infinite intelligence. Human senses are threedimensional
and can perceive only the threedimensional
aspect of energy-information, in the
form of ordinary 3D space, 3D particles and 3D
massive bodies

A Denebian probe may be considered a syntropic
phenomena, that is, a process 
responsible of the evolution of the biological
complexity. Life consists in a set of syntropic phenomena and cannot be
only reduced to physical and chemical processes
and therefore a source of information exists which
supervenes chemical and physical processes with
the aim of creation of biological systems

reality may be perceived as
a vast interlacing network of discrete fields of
oscillations that interact with the vibrational fields
of life systems, a communication process in which
photons of various energy content and solitons
play an essential role

if geometrical information fluxes of photons
and phonons converted to scalar standing waves
in a 4D toroidal topology can be considered the
basis for the origin of consciousness states, modulating 
those fluxes would theoretically allow you to generate specific consciousness states at will, 
regardless of the target species
