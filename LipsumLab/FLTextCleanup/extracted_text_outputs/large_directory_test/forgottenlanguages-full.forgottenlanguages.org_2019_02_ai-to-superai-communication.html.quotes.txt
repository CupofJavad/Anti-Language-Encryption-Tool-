The idea that the first contact with a supercivilization will be through  machines, and more specifically, by means of probes, is now the accepted paradigm. On the other hand, we must be ready for a non-friendly contact or, to be less  dramatic, for a contact in which the exchange of information is termed as hostile  by either partner. In this sense, we need to design proper contact strategies  based on real-life examples. This means we need to consider probes as predators  engaged in the finding of preys, and we need to account for the worst case scenario

Defenses can be divided into two categories: primary and secondary. Primary defenses are those that prevent detection by the predator. Secondary defenses promote survival after detection. The primary defenses are adaptive silence, stealth as in the modern military sense of the word, and acoustic crypsis. Secondary defenses will include prevention of localization, acoustic aposematism, mimicry, and communications jamming

The key defense used by Denebian probes is based on crypsis, that is, avoiding detection while remaining in plain sight. If we see them this is because they want us to see them

We understand we cannot tell the difference between a space exploration probe sent to make a first contact  with a civilization, and an interstellar probe aimed at detecting potential preys. Signals intercepted by another species, particularly in such cases as predators locating prey, should be considered cues as they are not designed to enhance information transfer to those receivers. This is certainly true if one considers predator and prey in isolation, and this is exactly the situation if we send a probe to DENIED to  meet the Denebian probe
