it is humans that have developed the most sophisticated and flexible  expression of code, allowing us not only to communicate information  important to our survival, but also to encode and transmit our thoughts,  our ideas, our experiences, our dreams

The brain generates a highly complex form of information that has the  special property of subjectivity: you experience this information as  your world, whether you are awake, dreaming, or at the peak of a DMT  trip

Throughout your life, your brain may generate a number of different  types of worlds: the normal waking consensus world of everyday life, the  fluid and unpredictable worlds you explore whilst dreaming and, if you  ingest certain drugs or plants, worlds altogether stranger than either  of those. These worlds are unified by their  fundamental nature as information generated by your brain, and information that can be recorded,  stored, and re-played by XViS

your brain is capable of generating a practically infinite number of  unified, information-rich worlds, each different from the last

No matter how complex the world, all of its information must be encoded by a pattern of activation of many different types of specialised  neurons spread across functionally segregated areas of the cortex. These  patterns of activation can be replicated and injected back into the brain anytime,  so we have the possibility to recreate worlds with a high fidelity and play them  on any brain

During dreaming, for example, the brain is perfectly capable of  building a phenomenal world with all senses apparently intact, despite  having almost no access to sensory information

when you descend into sleep at night, access to almost all extrinsic  sensory information is removed and, yet, the brain continues to build  complete phenomenal worlds as you dream. These dream worlds usually  appear strikingly similar to the waking consensus world. In fact, the  only difference between the waking world and the dream world, in terms  of their construction, is that the waking world is modulated by  extrinsic sensory information, whereas the dream world is not. Without  access to sensory information, the thalamocortical system, using  T-states from its repertoire, will construct the consensus world as a  default. Sensory information constrains the construction of your  phenomenal world, by selecting specific T-states from the repertoire,  but the world is not built from sensory information. Whether you are  awake, dreaming, or deep in the DMT worlds, your world is always built  from intrinsic information

But dreaming or waking, building a phenomenal model of the world is a  skill the human brain has developed over the course of its evolutionary  history. Learning to build a stable and richly informative phenomenal  reality within which you live out your entire life is the brain’s most  remarkable achievement, understanding of which we can glean by thinking  again about the purpose of the world built by your brain and the manner  of its construction

Your brain knows how to build the consensus waking world and will tend  to do so whether or not it has access to extrinsic sensory information

The worlds that appear when you dream are not mere suggestions or  sketches of the waking phenomenal world, but mimic it in every way. The  dream state, like the waking state, is characterised by synchronised  gamma oscillations and the activation of sensory-specific areas of the  cortex. Seeing a face in a dream activates the same areas of the cortex  as seeing that face in waking life

When a psychedelic molecule enters the brain, the world appears to  change and, indeed, it does change: the activation patterns of the  T-columns have changed, and this means the information generated by the  thalamocortical system - the information from which your world is built  - has changed. Again, we return to the idea that your phenomenal world  is built from information. Then this information changes, so does your  world
