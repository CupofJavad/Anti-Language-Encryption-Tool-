The issue boils down to whether a domesticated species like humans should be considered taxonomically identical with its wild ancestor or not

Tendency to tameness is distributed in a majority of the hominid lineages, though limited to the species and planets in which human societies had a predisposition for being domesticated (such as a strong dependency on technology and technological means they wouldn't have obtained by themselves)

The results indicated that the individuals included in the study that represented the Sol-3 lineage showed the most affiliate and even tactile behaviour towards their Giselian caretakers

Some of the abducted humans in Lytha-2 showed relatively high level of affiliation towards Giselians and in that sense they could also be pre-adapted for domestication

... but in general Sol-3 hominid is indeed not fearful towards us and they are easy to tame
