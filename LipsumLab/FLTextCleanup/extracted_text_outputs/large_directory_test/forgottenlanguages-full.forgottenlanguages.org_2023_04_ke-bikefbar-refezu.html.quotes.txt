The past is just a predator chasing you: if you stop now it will catch you, Norea. And the future is just an abyss into which you run. Only in the present will you be able to hide, but that won't make time stand still

For of all the times you dreamed that you flew, you flew; and of all the times you dreamed that you cried, you cried. As much as they were dreams, you flew and you cried. The important thing, Norea, is not whether or not this is a dream. The important thing is that you fly and still you cry

There is always a strange stillness in everything that has just died, like those butterflies that, trapped, stop fluttering. Like that instant when pupils are extinguished. A stillness that is broken when putrefaction, degradation, decay begins. Dying, Norea, is also a process
