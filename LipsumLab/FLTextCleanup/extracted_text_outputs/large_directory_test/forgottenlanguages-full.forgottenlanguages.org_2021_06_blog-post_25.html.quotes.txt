Traits not important for survival are not as strongly subject to the forces of natural selection and thus may appear unsuited to a particular environment at a particular time

As for DP-2147, there is no reason to think that what we are really tracking here is the difference between conscious and non-conscious cognition. We cannot even identify whether the object is alive. We have no markers of life to use as a guide. We need to bear in mind that some processes that may require consciousness in humans could be performed non-consciously by other entities that have evolved or otherwise developed in different ways. Finally, we have no idea on how to decide whether an object is a living organism or a robot. We humans tend to believe that an organism must be mostly organic, hence we readily label a washing-machine as a machine, that is, an artificial object. But this distinction fails to explain why we humans are easily simulated by LyAv. LyAv consistently label hman beings as robots, as machines; surprisingly, it labels an octopus as a conscious living being
