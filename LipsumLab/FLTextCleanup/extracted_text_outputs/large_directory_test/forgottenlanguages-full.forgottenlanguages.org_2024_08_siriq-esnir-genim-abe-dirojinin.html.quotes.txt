Religions have been hanging carrots in front of you. Those hopes are never fulfilled, they are hopeless, those promises are empty

You need to change, indeed, but now there is no time left. This you should have asked in the beginning. Then there was a possibility, but not now

With
each letter
of your epitaph
I make a star gate
whose threshold I cross
when it pleases me,
to travel
in all times,
to any place
wherever you are.
But you ignore it,
you don't believe it,
and you shudder
if I tell you...
that before you
were born...
... I already met you
