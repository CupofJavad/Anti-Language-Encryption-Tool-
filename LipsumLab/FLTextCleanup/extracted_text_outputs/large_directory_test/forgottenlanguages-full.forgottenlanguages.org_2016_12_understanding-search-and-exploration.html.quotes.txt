The basic framework within which we are currently operating in the exploration of exoplanets does not differ much from the one we applied during the first Apollo missions to our Moon; we keep on assuming that our missions will visit sites that are representative of the major provinces of the exoplanet under exploration and will have as a principal function the collection of samples from the regions visited, provided those exoplanets are uninhabited. If any of them happens to be inhabited, the entire strategy would change. But it will be too late

, that is, sites that contain features that are unambiguously representative of the individual processes they are investigating. There is an intimate coupling between the mission capability and the site selection. The choice of North America and Taaami Desert sites - and the absolute lack of type sites in Europe - can be explained by that logic. The recovery of object
DENIED
and
DENIED
in Texas fits into that exploration strategy, while the sightnings over
DENIED
and other nuclear waste sites do better fit into a monitoring strategy, rather than a pure exploration strategy. Furthermore, the confirmed use of some kind of muon tomography by recovered object
DENIED
clearly matches what you should expect for a nuclear site monitoring probe

Yes, there are patterns that suggest the strategy they are following is one aimed at exploration, colonization, and exploitation. And yes, the Yulara event clearly points to that direction

At their stage of technological development, they still need ground truth data, so they need to select landing sites, and actually land. In this sense this second type of visitors are no different to us

We have made the exercise to design mission plans to explore planet Earth, as if we were the aliens ourselves. Our aim was to come up with a set of strategies that would allow us to figure out how would we actually explore a planet that is inhabited, should we face that scenario in the near future. But the relevant part of the exercise is that it has allowed us to 'think' the way our visitors do, and to use that information to model and predict, somehow, the patterns of sightings we do experience
