This was a time when thinkers were daring to question accepted dogmas 
and orthodoxies. No thinkers like those can be found today, in particular in an atmosphere dominated by money, which hinders the fostering of a flowering of
original philosophical and scientific thought.  Today's mercantilism has become terrifyingly
oppressive. Thinkers who dare to think differently are silenced


In everyday life, agents do not seek, or even need scientific 
understanding of the world in a way that is afforded by clear and 
distinct perceptions; suffice to say, agents merely seek to 'get
around' in the world


Although sensations provide merely confused and
obscure information about the natures of things, their function is
not to inform agents about the natures of things, but rather to help
preserve the mind-body union by representing things in the world and
thereby informing agents whether those things are suitable or
unsuitable for the survival of the mind-body union
