Despite the polygraph’s shortcomings, there is currently no viable technical alternative to polygraphy. After reviewing the EEG and fMRI deception detection efforts, as well as some other psychophysiological candidate techniques (e.g., VSA), the National Research Council concluded that “some of the potential alternatives show promise, but none has yet been shown to outperform the polygraph. None shows any promise of supplanting the polygraph for screening purposes in the near term”. This does not imply that these efforts have no value. On the contrary, the results to date show that these approaches have promise, and may even be viable in some situations where their level of accuracy is acceptable. However, much more research is needed if these techniques are to become operationally useful and reliable in situations that require a higher level of accuracy
