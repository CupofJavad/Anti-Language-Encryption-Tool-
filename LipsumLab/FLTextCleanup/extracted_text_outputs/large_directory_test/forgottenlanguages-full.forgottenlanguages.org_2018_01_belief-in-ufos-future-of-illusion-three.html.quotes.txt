 is a unified thing

 until Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, British and American societies began to have prolonged encounters with one another, particularly during the Cold War period, and more importantly, due precisely to the fact that the Cold War required them to interact on behalf of defense. Definitely, UFOs and aliens is just a Five Eyes illusion

All data gathered point conclusively to two objects, one being Flight DENIED and the other one an uknown. The wreckage trail starting point is 3430 metres from the DENIED road. The aircraft first came into contact with trees some 18 metres in height and the overall trail was 53 metres in width as its widest point and extended for some 310 metres

This report presents the body measurements of DENIED bodies recovered from incident site related to entry event DENIED. We show the means, standard deviations, coefficients of variation, percentiles, and related statistics of standard anthropometric and functional measurements. This report is initiated on behalf of DENIED

Using the sliding caliper we measure the vertical distance from subnasale to nasion and the maximum horizontal breadth of the nose... measures taken with the digital anthropometer show a horizontal depth of the chest at the level of the inferior margin of the xiphoid process to be consistent with human beings, most likely 3 females..
