How should I fence off my soul, what walls to erect around it so that I don’t lose myself? My dreams take me too far away, too far away music and tears take me. I can’t contain myself anymore, and I don’t have space for myself in myself anymore; how can I contain others then, how can I make space for them? Do we love from plenitude or from poverty? When I can’t contain myself anymore, can an other approach my center? Will the soul which dies from its life love? The soul full of holes fills them through love; seeks others from poverty. Love is begging, it is the terror of its own smallness. How much contempt and generosity there is in the love that comes from plenitude. Then you love to get rid of yourself, you throw away love! You worship Eros to get rid of yourself, your surpluses and excesses: you adore the liberation from your tempest

That’s when all the dreams we’ve had so far will be reborn in ourselves, all the dreams of our nights, all the absurd and the imaginary stuff, woven in our unconscious by our fear, our voluptuousness, and our hidden pain. I thought that the dreams had died in us with every day and every night that passed. But the voluptuous decomposition of our soul, under the vast spring sky, is the call of remembrance

Imagine death as an immaterial dissolution in the infinite, as an ethereal leap, death as a dream and a poem of matter! But not death as a type of verifying matter, as an illustration of the laws of human nature, as a fatality of human nature.
I don’t revolt against death, but against the way of dying
