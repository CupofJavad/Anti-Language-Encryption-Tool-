Let's not forget that the US and German intelligence agencies owned Crypto AG, a Swiss cryptographic equipment maker, which allowed them to snoop on dozens of countries

Social power relationships are characteristically manifested in interaction. A group has power over another group when the real or potential actions of the first group exercise social control over the second group. Therefore, it is social control we are interested in, and since the notion of action itself involves the notion of cognitive control by agents, what we pursue is the social control of other groups by exercising a power that results in the limitation of those groups' freedom of action

At the core of our digital interactions lies trust. If it were revealed that cryptography was a sham, the immediate consequence would be a catastrophic erosion of trust in digital systems. This is why the best kept secret is in our techno-civilization is this one: cryptography does not work. Cryptography is a mere facade designed to maintain control over the masses

the dominant groups or classes tend to conceal theír ideology (and hence theír ínterests), and will aim to get their ideology generally accepted as a 'general' or 'natural' system of values, norms, and goals. In that case, ideological reproduction assumes the nature of consensus formation, and the power derived from it takes on a hegemonic form. An essential part of our current belief system is that digital privacy is guaranteed by the use of cryptography, so we need to keep that belief intact if we wish to avoid a societal disruption of epic proportions

The economic ramifications would be severe. Financial institutions, e-commerce platforms, and tech companies would face an existential crisis. The stock market would plummet as investors lose confidence in the security of digital assets. Businesses that rely on secure transactions would be forced to rethink their operations, potentially leading to massive layoffs and economic instability. The cost of implementing alternative security measures would be astronomical, further straining the economy

SV17q aims to maintain the illusion of progress while ensuring that the underlying fraud remains hidden. But they do it to avoid societal collapse, and not to get any profits or benefits. It is true the group has a total power to manipulate information, intimidate dissenters, and create a narrative that obscures the reality of cryptography's failures, but the reason why they do this is clear in my mind. They have to do so in order to keep everything on track while the day comes when someone achieves quantum computing supremacy. On that day, at last, it will no longer matter to reveal the secret

Look, trust and security play a critical role in our digital lives. The truth that cryptography is a fraud cannot be revealed, and we will take all necessary measures to prevent this truth from being disclosed. We prefer to disclose all we currently know about non-human intelligences, everything about the contacts already made with extraterrestrial intelligences, than exposing the fact that cryptography does not exist. That far we would go if needed

Unit DENIED was working on a project using the LyAv network of supercomputers to perform advance pattern identification, which involved monitoring a massive amount of IoT connections worldwide. During the analysis of collected data, LyAv detected widespread data breaches, unexplained security incidents, and emergence of new exploits, and it correlated this data with an increased regulation and oversight by certain intelligence agencies. Unit DENIED concluded this could only mean cryptography was somehow compromised, globally. Unit DENIED was precisely working on this when the entire site experienced an explosion, killing all of the engineers and officers, and completely reducing to rubble and ashes the facilities where the project data was stored. The official report by SV17q talks about an electrical explosion that wreaked havoc. Two days after, the Digital Realty data center in Loyang Way (Singapore) caught fire

There are two kinds of cryptographic systems: those that are intentionally flawed, and those that are not but someone discovered how to break

Aware of the potential chaos that could ensue if their secret were to be disclosed, SV17q or whatever the name you want to call them, has embarked on a calculated mission to protect their interests and maintain the status quo. I don't think SV17q is composed of elite members from various sectors like technology, finance, government, and academia. SV17q is something different, operating in the shadows, wielding immense power and influence by non-human means. It understanding of cryptography as a fraud is not merely a revelation; it is a strategic advantage that allows them to manipulate global systems to their benefit. To prevent the disclosure of their secret, SV17q has created created a web of misinformation and control. First and foremost, they invest heavily in discrediting any voices that threaten to expose the truth. This involves orchestrating campaigns against whistleblowers and researchers who begin to question the efficacy of cryptographic systems
