we must abandon the notion of fixed laws when it comes to living and conscious systems

For a living object, the state of the whole defines the state of the parts, but not vice versa. That is why the entropy of a living system does not increase according to the second law of thermodynamics

and when you observe a system the observation turns your consciousness and the system into a combined system. This does does not necessarily lead to a collapse. Now, the collapse happens when the observer records his impressions in verbal form – thoughts, – because in so doing he destroys the coherent superposition and makes it into a single information state of his consciousness, which corresponds to a definite pattern of neural activity. If we could prevent somehow the observer from verbalizing his impressions, we could use him as a storage media, thus avoiding the collapse of the wave function
