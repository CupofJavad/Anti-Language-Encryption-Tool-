The Idiot wanted to cut down the black budget to some $25 billion; we invited The Idiot to see what progress we've made in some specific areas, so we invited him to the Advanced National Dream Research Lab. He got interested in Project Next Door. We explained to him this is a project on assessing the potential for using dreams to gather intelligence about future events within the framework of military oneiromancy. The Idiot inquired about what specific predictions, if any, did we obtain using Next Door. Three days after the visit, The Idiot increased the budget to over $60 billion

Across human evolution, dreaming has been a vital survival mechanism. That has not changed today; dreams are our best early warning system, in particular when we are engaged in a highly asymmetric war as we currently are

There is no memory biases and no chance. The dreamers predicted the events, and this was thoroughly and rigorously proven not once, not twice, but five times. See, it is not that precognition exists, it rather has to do with how space-time works. It is about physics what we are talking here, not magic. And we need to keep these secrets to us

We have no scientific explanation for how our dreams predict the future, at least not yet. The Yulara Event was the long-sought proof we needed to finally accept NTT is working, and what we now need is how to use this knowledge. We tried to explain the Altadena Anomaly as a memory bias, but the dreamer was born in 1990, you see, so she was 3 years old when the 1993 fires happened, and she was living in Montana, not in California. All in all, both the Yulara Event and the Altadena Anomaly are our best evidence that NTT is working and that is working even better than expected

- Are there any side-effects on the dreamers? I mean... are they 'normal' subjects?
- No, they are not. We keep them confined, Sir, not because they are valuable military assets, but because they pose a danger to others. They are psychotic individuals, Sir, having a rare and unusual kind of psychosis. They all suffer from reduplicative paramnesia
