we need a radically different mathematics if we wish to detect not only signals of new particles not included in the standard phenomenological scenario, but also signals produced by standard particles crossing our space-time but coming from an outside brane where physics is the same but some of the fundamental physical parameters are appreciably different

the dimension of the parallel universe common to ours is time to us, but in the parallel universe the role of time is played by a dimension of an alien to it universe, probably, ours. We are sure they are as baffled by those lights in their skies as we are

It is not whether there is only a pair of universes or whether every dimension can penetrate into some universe or other making an infinite series of universes. It is whether our current maths can represent those models or not. I know we consider mathematics as one of our most brilliant achievements, yet we need to recognize our maths is extremely childish and unsuited for the task currently at hand

A grammar is a device that generates the sentences of the language it describes by means of given axioms and by the operation of rules, independently of all external input. All sentences, the whole language, are contained in its grammar
