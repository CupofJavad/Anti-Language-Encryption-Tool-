intelligent races that has reached a level of technology where they can run simulations of reality so detailed they can be mistaken for reality will naturally use voids as testing grounds; those simulations are clearly dangerous and pose an existential risk for the simulators if they don't take due care. You don't want to create a simulation so perfect than you cannot distinguish it from reality

without a reference world, one cannot tell the world one is living in is real or a simulated one. Therefore, there is no absolute meaning for reality

let's assume you are currently dreaming, in which case many of your beliefs about the world are incorrect; but it can also happen that you are and have always been dreaming, in which case the objects you perceive actually exist, albeit in your imagination

It is possible to build a virtual reality generator whose repertoire includes every physically possible environment. However, in order to include every physically possible environment, the computer would have to be able to include a full simulation of the environment containing itself. Even so, a computer running a simulation need not have to run every possible physical moment to be plausible to its inhabitants
