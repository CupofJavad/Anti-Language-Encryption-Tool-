the cogenesis mechanism needs to understand how to find the correct data beyond the accessible physical experience, or otherwise there will be a critical point in the evolution of the terraforming agents which will compromise the entire terraforming scheme. That critical point is reached when the engineered terraformers get aware that they are mere instruments used to perform tasks. Under this scenario, humans in Sol-3 could someday be aware of who designed them, and for what purpose. We assume being suddenly aware that one is just a mere instrument of a higher civilization could certainly cause a systemic failure of the entire terraforming scheme, and that's why the essential data is placed outside the human accessible physical experience

In the Giselian cogenesis scheme, essential data is stored there where you can physically access it yet you cannot experience it: the hidden dimensions of space-time

The execution area is a planetary structure managed by terraformers, say, Sol-3. To control the cogenesis scheme you need to be able to also implement a regression system and produce actionable data for further actions to be performed. This can only be achieved if you separate the control of humans from their configuration data, and the only way we've found so far is to store that configuration data outside their physical accessible reality. The problem is humans were configured to have consciousness in order for the cogenesis mechanism to work, and consciousness, by design, can access realities beyond the physically accessible ones

A cogenesis mechanism in which the agents - humans - live scripted lives is prone to fail as complexity and capabilities grow over time. First, the regression control system will become unstable, and second, humans will stop performing properly once they know they are living a scripted life

Watchers' main task is in verifying designs, not debugging them
