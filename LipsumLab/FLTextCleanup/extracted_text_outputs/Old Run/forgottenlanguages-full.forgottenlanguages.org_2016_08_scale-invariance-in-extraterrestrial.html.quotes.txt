an adequate model of sightings should not only give us indications of where or when events are likely to occur, but also tell us how significant they are likely to be

extremal events recorded are not outliers, but are instead in concordance with a global pattern in sightings. This pattern shows the locations are not chosen at random but, instead, it is governed by a strict relationship between the frequency and intensity of sightings

it is true that extreme Gisel and Yulara-type events do occur with much greater frequency than we would expect from our traditional artificial exploring probes models of sightings, but their incidence has also been surprisingly stable over the past 70 years. This suggests that with respect to their frequency and severity, there is nothing fundamentally new about recent sightings, except that we now know how to identify the different origins of the probes involved in these sightings

The conclusion is that the current doctrine of detecting, identifying, and neutralizing Denebian probes only worsens the situation, for we are obviously neutralizing those faulty or underperforming probes; due to their replicative nature, what we are actually doing is acting as a natural selection agent, purging the pool of probes leaving intact the fittest ones, something which clearly runs against our interest

the most reasonable explanation is that we are facing equilibrium critical phenomena in spatially extended systems, that is, we are viewing the result of the interplay between different types of exoplanetary probes with different target assignments, sometimes even conflicting ones, and that those who designed the probes already accounted for the unavoidable neutralization and destruction of the worst performing probes, allowing the probe replicating process to generate more robust and efficient probes after each replication cycle. That's the art of artificial replicating probes: let your enemy destroy the weakest probes in order to improve the final stock of probes
