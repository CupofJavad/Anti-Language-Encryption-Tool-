Beneath this solemn stone, rests a soul once alive, Whose echoes of dreams into the abyss strive, In realms obscure, where fantasies did gleam, Now lies eternal, forever lost, in the realm of dreams

Here lies a soul who dared to chase dreams amidst the abyss, forever embracing the limitless realm of possibilities. In the depths of the abyss he found solace, where dreams whispered their secrets and that weary heart finally found peace

Amongst the shadows of the abyss, their dreams soared like stars, forever illuminating the path of those who dared to follow. Now look: here lie they dreamers, who fearlessly ventured into the abyss, discovering that even in darkness, dreams can blossom like wildflowers
