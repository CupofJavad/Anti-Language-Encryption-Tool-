So A and B enter into the following agreement: A will send a message, at three o'clock if and only if he does not receive one at one o'clock. B sends a message to reach A at one o'clock immediately on receiving one from A at two o'clock. Then the exchange of messages will take place if and only if it does not take place

The phenomenon of the redshift is a well-understood effect in which the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation is lengthened as a result either of the source moving away from the observer – the so-called Doppler effect – or by the actual expansion of the Universe. However, the redshift caused by the expansion of the Universe has nothing to do with the Doppler effect but is thought to be caused by the expansion of space itself, which is felt to stretch the wavelength of the radiation that is travelling towards the observer. Therefore, even if the message comes from the future it must be red-shifted somehow because that's what we would expect from photons. Sure they could have used tachyons to send the message to the past, but in that case we wouldn't have detected the message because we know not how to detect tachyons

Our conclusion is the message comes from the future, probably from a point around 19546.52891.92183.31 along the timeline

Sending a message to the far past, for instance to the Paleolithic, would be stupid because the beings living at that time have no means to detect any signal at all. However, sending information 2 hours into the past would exponentially increase the computing power of a computer starting a computation 2 hours before because the computer would have received the information it requires even before starting any computation at all. Imagine now that the information consist of a description on how to send messages into the past; this means the computer of 2 hours ago now knows how to send messages into the past. Assume we create a chain of computers located along the timeline stretching far into the past up to the first computer humans ever built..
