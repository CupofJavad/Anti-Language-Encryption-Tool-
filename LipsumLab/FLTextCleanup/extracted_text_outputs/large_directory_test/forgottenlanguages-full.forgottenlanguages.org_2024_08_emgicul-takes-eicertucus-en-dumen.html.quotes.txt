With the development of hermetic, magical, and cabalistic thought, thanks also to the immense work of the translation of the classics on Hermeticism and Neoplatonism undertaken by Marsilio Ficino, new perspectives emerged. Philosophers such as Pico, Reuchlin, Trithemius, Agrippa, Campanella, Bruno, to name just a few, went beyond the simple description or theoretical treatment of angelological issues. On the basis of magical-cabalistic knowledge, the magician-philosopher claimed that interaction with these beings was possible

Around the beginning of the fifteenth century, the diocese of Bologna became an independent inquisitorial district, with its own inquisitor. From 1451, inquisitors in Bologna also relied on the Crocesegnati (Society of the Cross), a confraternity of lay auxiliaries who were supposed to assist them in carrying out their inquisitorial duties

The rites of demonic magic were contained in books and presupposed a command of Latin. Hence, most practitioners of demonic magic in the late Middle Ages belonged to Europe’s educated elite. Necromancers were commonly individuals who were clerics, including university students and men in minor orders, often monks, friars, or diocesan priests.

While awaiting the court’s resolution, the soldier modified his account and said that he had experienced the encounters with the forest nymph as if in a dream. He was eventually set free and referred to the priests for religious instruction

This debate developed between two competent actors: the magician, who was an expert in invocations, and the opponent, who was careful enough not to try it, but who analyzed the handbooks accurately before burning them. The issue they were discussing played a crucial role in the life of magical manuals, since not only the content of the handbooks served as a soil for the arguments, but the controversy itself also influenced the texts. A handbook can disguise itself if it does not want to become a victim in the fight of opinions, it can appear more innocent than it is in reality
