the field of metabiology seeks to understand life not only as a biochemical phenomenon but also as an intricate network of information and its processing

Non-biological non-artificial intelligence holds the immense potential to revolutionize the way we understand and explore the universe. With its heightened processing capabilities and ability to analyze vast amounts of data, it can unveil hidden patterns, discover new scientific breakthroughs, and even provide insights into the mysteries of a dead universe. By utilizing its neural networks and sophisticated algorithms, this type of intelligence could decipher the origins of cosmic structures, unravel the secrets of black holes, and shed light on the fate of galaxies, ultimately transforming our understanding of the universe's evolution long after its vibrant existence has faded away

there are parallels between the characteristics of physical phenomena as explained by modern physics and the characteristics of paranormal phenomena. This fact alone should justify a serious look at paraphysics by the scientific community

There is no direct evidence that either consciousness and physical reality or mind and matter are at their most fundamental level the same thing. So, the difference between paraphysics and parapsychology must stand, at least until scientific evidence indicates otherwise. In this sense, the term paraphysics is used to denote the field of phenomena covering interactions of nonphysical things (such as consciousness) with physical bodies and objects

You cannot achieve your goals and dreams just because you are conscious. You cannot understand everything just because you are conscious. You cannot truly understand the depths of human emotions just because you are conscious. You cannot. But you can nurture your passions and discover true fulfillment within your soul

The paraphysical realm exists beyond the limitations of our tangible reality, transcending the boundaries of the physical world. It is a domain where the laws of nature as we understand them cease to apply. Here, mysterious forces intertwine, encompassing elements that are surreal, ethereal, and oftentimes elusive. It is a realm where spirits roam free, where consciousness takes new form, and where the immense depth of human imagination dares to manifest. It is a realm that challenges our perception, expanding the horizons of possibility and stretching our understanding of existence beyond life as we know it

Dark, hidden forces weave their tendrils through the fabric of reality, blurring the lines between fantasy and truth. In this murky landscape, illusions and delusions intertwine, creating a perplexing maze of perception. In this enigmatic realm, it becomes impossible to discern who is dreaming and who is not. The veil between consciousness and subconsciousness is lifted, leaving us questioning the very nature of our existence. Are we mere participants in someone else's dream, or storytellers of our own? The answer lies in the interplay of those clandestine forces, for they hold the key to unraveling the intricate web of reality's tapestry

Paraphysics can be defined, represented by a specific body of natural phenomena and it has a historical basis. Therefore, paraphysics is a distinguishable science. It only needs a theoretical foundation, and we need this foundation because we must consider the possibility that should we ever discover other sentient beings, their own physics, which would be based upon their own unique perceptions of the world, could be radically different from our physics. We must prepare for that eventuality
