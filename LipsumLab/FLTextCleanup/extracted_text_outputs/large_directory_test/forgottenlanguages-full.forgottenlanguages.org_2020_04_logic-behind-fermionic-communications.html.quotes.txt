particles have no past. And if they don’t, we cannot actually know if  one was ever near an object and interacted with it. When we measure a  particle to find out, the wave function that could have told us  collapses. We do not learn history from particles, we force history upon them

by that time, it was not clear how two observers could communicate to  each other the information about the microscopic nature of their worlds.  We assumed both us and them could encode information into polarized gravitational waves or even photons, provided there is a kinetic mixing between two photons.  The discovery of the dark photons made us think they could play the role of the messenger between our world and the next parallel world, so the entire idea  is to set up the Queltron Machine to exchange photons and mirror photons through  the bulk in order to exchange information with our fermionic neighbours

We first tried using neutrinos, though we soon learned that they can only be  used if parity between the two worlds is exact because then the neutrinos of the two sectors will be strongly mixed. However, the mirror world is not  exactly like ours, and hence parity is not exact
