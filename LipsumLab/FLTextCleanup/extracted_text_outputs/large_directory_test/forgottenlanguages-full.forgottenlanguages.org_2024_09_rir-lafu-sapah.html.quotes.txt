This sacred plant, with its bell-shaped blossoms, carries the heartbeat of the ancients, and gives life and death. As its potent essence courses through the veins, it ignites a dance of vitality, quickening the pulse and sharpening the senses. Yet, within this fervor lies a delicate balance, for the same force that breathes life can also summon shadows. Be careful when handling this plant, and remember that the mystic knows it is a mirror to the soul, reflecting both the fragility and strength of existence, urging us to tread lightly on the path between healing and harm

With each careful preparation, she invokes the ethereal, for this enchanting herb is said to be a bridge to the celestial realms. As the dark, glistening berries are crushed, their essence releases a fragrant smoke that spirals upward, beckoning the angels to descend

After the herb made its work inside me, the stars, once my companions in the night sky, now seem distant and indifferent, their brilliance obscured by the clouds of uncertainty. I find myself adrift in a vast ocean of questions, where the shores of certainty have eroded, leaving only the tumultuous waves of despair

Alchemy, with its promises of transmutation and the quest for the philosopher's stone, seeks to bind the ephemeral to the eternal, yet I see it as a mere reflection of our longing for mastery over the chaos of existence. The divine, I ponder, is not a distant architect orchestrating our fates, but rather the very essence of the cosmos. To chase after gold or immortality is to miss the profound beauty of the present moment
