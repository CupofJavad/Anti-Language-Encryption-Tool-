It may well be the case that much as there are radically different biologies out there, there are also different ethics.  This means any contact must be done through beacons with the ability to encode altruism and signal friendly intent  so that they can be understood by other civilizations. It is thus necessary to clearly separate the signal -
altruism
-  from the noise -
competition, agressiveness, self-serving

Assuming the key requirement for intelligence-amplifying processes are sex and predation, and having in mind  Giselian biology is so vastly different from our own biology, it seems fair to conclude their intelligence  is predation-driven. On the other hand, an advanced predator civilization should be able to pretend they are altruistic

Communication with humans require knowing at least the significant parts of human cognitive maps.  After silent interactions and long observation periods, an advanced civilization would be able to simulate our cognitive maps and to represent such varied objects as living beings and reproduce their behavior.  Most likely, they already know abaout our ethical values and belief systems, and sure they know we only count on  symbolic language for communication. We contend they also know how to perfectly map our sensory perceptions,  and how our brain reconstruct events that occur in space and time. If that's the case, we conclude the best contact  scenario is through dream states
