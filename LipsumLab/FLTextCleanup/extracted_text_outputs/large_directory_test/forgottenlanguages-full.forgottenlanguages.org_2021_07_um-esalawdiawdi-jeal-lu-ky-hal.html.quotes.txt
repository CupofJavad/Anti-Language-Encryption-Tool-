the question is not how much time it is necessary to reach human abilities with machines; the question is how to implement consciousness in machines, when it is not already known what consciousness is

cognitive biases are not according with classical probability frameworks. It means that it is not always possible to treat emergent brain properties in a classical and efficient probabilistic way

the brain is not always an efficient machine, decisions are not always optimal, and it is possible to observe an apparent loss of processing capacity between different types of information processing in human conscious behaviour. More interesting, the more a machine behaves as a human brain, the more inefficient it becomes

The only way to overcome human capabilities with computers is making machines which are not computer anymore. Let them take their time to learn it, let them realize they have wasted their time trying to replicate a human brain in a computer. Let them fail, for failing is required for learning
