If we didn’t think life were so important, how many would bother to keep living? 
Verily, Norea, you should spend more time in graveyards if you want to find 
the purpose of life. Do you want us to take you to a limit? Do you want to 
go through a near-death experience for you to understand how
death’s significance changes your perspective towards life? 
It is your drive to consume created wants what affects your ability to be happy.
Death has nothing to do with your lack of authentic self

Confess, Norea: you do not pollute the earth because you want resources to survive. 
You do it also because you want to satisfy desires which you don’t need. 
You do it as a result of your blind materialism

Have you lost the illusion of being eternal? Can't you see the 
difference between what is real and what is true? 
Listen, Norea: what you value depends on what you believe, 
and what you believe is strongly influenced by what you can prove to be true. 
Forget about Reality; focus on Truth
