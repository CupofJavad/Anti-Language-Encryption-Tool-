Nor do I dream there ever browsed in wood
So wild a creature, either night or day,
As she whom I lament in shade and sun,
And weary, not with weeping, eve or dawn,
Since, though my mortal body be of earth,
My love unchanging cometh from the stars

it is possible to use both the photon pressure of a star and its gravitational tug to decelerate and deflect an incoming stellar probe. Computations show that the Denebian probe under investigation did not originate in Cen-
a
, rather it followed a close orbit as a swing-by maneuver to both Cen-
b
and Proxima Centauri in order to achieve a bound orbit around Sol-3

You search in deep space,
You listen expecting to hear,
But all you see are shadows, dreams and haze.
For your soul knows the way,
she seeks the skies,
she listens to the stars.
You are not satisfied,
neither with whom you are,
nor with what you have;
Deep inside you
there is a most tranquil and sloshy ocean,
that peacefully gives birth
to those sapphire waves
that are all you are

Assuming incoming probes are essentially light-sails, it will take them some 75 to 95 years to cover the distance between the
a
-Centauri system and Sol-3 so that we should expect them to arrive somewhere between 2095 and 2110. If they are light-sails there is no other way for them to reach Sol-3 than to perform a final swing-by maneuver using the
a
-Centauri System, which is the closest star to Sol
