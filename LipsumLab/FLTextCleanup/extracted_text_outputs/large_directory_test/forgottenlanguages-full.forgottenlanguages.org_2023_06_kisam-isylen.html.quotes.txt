Recognise the fact that these base passions do not give you strength, but lead to weakness. Recognise the fact that good feeling towards all mankind brings power, that love to all creatures brings power.

There is a voice, the cry of a babe, within, constantly calling you and asking you to listen. That is the awakening soul, longing for the Inner Knowledge which will bring you to all things.
