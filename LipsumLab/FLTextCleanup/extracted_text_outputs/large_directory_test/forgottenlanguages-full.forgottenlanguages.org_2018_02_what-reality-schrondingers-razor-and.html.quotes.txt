when a civilization reduces Science to Ideology, it is signing its death sentence; the entire peer review process simply implanted ideology over analysis, and your entire health and environmental sciences is just mere ideology. Ideology makes you blind to see global warming, for instance, but it makes you even blind to Reality. The best kept secret is this: even all of your quantum mechanics is ideology. You are not even a Type-0 civilization, for you are no civilization at all

We just only recently began to recognize the key role of hallucinosis. Hallucinosis (presence of delusion and hallucination in a personality otherwise conserved) is a complex process by which hallucinations remain unseen, passing for normal. The consequent thought and visual disturbances are disguised by rationality. Under hallucinosis, you experiment hallucinations without being aware of them. This is the mechanism on which contact with NTT is based

Yulara taught us a lot about them. See, the site was fully monitored, cameras installed around the perimeter, detectors were all over the place, everything was recorded at any imaginable wavelength. The entire encounter took the form of an hallucination, except that the detectors detected, the cameras recorded, and the observers observed. This made us wonder whether there exists a new type of hallucination in which detectors can also be tricked to detect objects and a presence that, according to the laws of physics, cannot be there

Hallucinosis is just a consequence of the mirror world. Give Schrödinger Occam's razor, and give Occam Schrödinger's cat and what you get is just that: the phenomena. This is just a new form of mind-matter interaction, but in this case the mind is your mind and the matter comes from the hidden dimension. This would explain why detectors detect objects, but only your mind and not mine does, even when we both were there at the same time. That's how I see it
