God is a mediocre being and created man to his likeness and image. The Mediocre Man, like any god, is the natural enemy of the man of genius and conviction: an enemy at the same time most cruel and ferocious. He opposes to the man of genius that most cruel and redoubtable of forces: the power of inertia. The Mediocre Man and his gods are much more evil than they appear. Their basic wickedness is hidden beneath their external frigidity. They both peddle against the enthusiasts their endless little infamies, which, because they are little, are never taken for infamies. Sure they are fearless, knowing they has behind them the multitudes of their similars. They never fight, knowing they have gained the victory in advance
