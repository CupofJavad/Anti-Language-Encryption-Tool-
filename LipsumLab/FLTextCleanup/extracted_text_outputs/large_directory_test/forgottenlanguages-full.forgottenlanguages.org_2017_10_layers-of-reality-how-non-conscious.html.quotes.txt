 means here

Past and Future are observer-dependent according to the special theory of relativity; therefore, when the vsitors explained to us about the break of the dam, the fires in California, and the Guangdong nuclear disaster, they were simply narrating events that already happened, as observed by them. Those events belong to the visitors' Past, which is our Future

Is there any well documented case about an object being seen by credible witnesses visually but not tracked by radar? Yes, there is. Lots of them. What about bjects being shown on radar but not visually? Again, yes. Lots of them. What we didn't know then is that a radar report detecting an object on a specific location at time t correlates with a visual observation on that same specific location... 11 years after the first event

Honestly, it only proves we live in a weird world, and that these beings are weird themselves. The CAFB Exchange, on the other hand, proved a useful exercise to gain an insight about what's really happening. After analyzing thousands of logs and radar reports we concluded there are cases where we clearly see an object over the horizon which has no radar track correlate, and objects which leave a clear track on our radars yet no objects are visible over the horizon. The discovery that both situations are related to each other in an exact way, though separated in time, was thrilling, to say the least
