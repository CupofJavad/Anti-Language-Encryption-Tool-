reading from the sensors revealed that during the Yulara event both soldiers were receiving a stream of vivid experiences, and that occurred despite both of them being immobile, unresponsive, and largely disconnected from the environment

The goal of understanding the specific nature of these contacts, and the altered phenomenology that surrounds them, stands as the most important experimental challenge

We don't yet fully understand the fundamental aspects of brain temperature regulation. What we observe is that during the contact the high-frequency activity in prefrontal regions drop dramatically. See, those regions mediate cognitive functions that are unconscious but affect experience indirectly, such as the encoding and storing of long-term memories, so that if they are blocked somehow by the NTT this would explain the loss of memory experienced by the subject. Though we can record and monitor the entire contact experience, it is frustrating that the subject who is in direct contact with them does not remember anything of the contact
