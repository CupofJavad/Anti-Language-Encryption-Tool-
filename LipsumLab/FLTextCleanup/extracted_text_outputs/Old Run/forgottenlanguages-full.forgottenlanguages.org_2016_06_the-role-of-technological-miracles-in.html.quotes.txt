The need to have language may be a pancultural universal problem; and having a language may be a universal solution to this problem. But the specific way in which each culture solves this problem—that is, develops its own language—is different in every culture

If we content culture is a shared system of socially transmitted behaviour that describes, defines, and guides people’s ways of life, communicated from one generation to the next, tampering with culture in specific ways would allow to shape global development of a civilization. From miracles to UFO sightings our role has always been to mentor and guide people's ways of life taking due care to avoid disconnecting them from their natural evolutionary path

We obviously need to introduce new types of fears in order to lead a lesser civilization's evolutionary history to a greater probability of survival, and to guarantee that same civilization overcomes the self-destruction point. You always learn from horrible accidents

biological imperatives dictate the rules of adaptation and living, hence genetic manipulation is sometimes prescribed as a way to increase survival probability, even after the environment has been modified and manipulated to drive a species development. Changing the environment might be expected to produce at least a temporary change in default patterns of perception, and if that fails, genetic manipulation is the last resort

emotion communication and recognition is vital for intelligent interspecies communication. Contacting another intelligent species will fail if emotions cannot be recognized and communicated
