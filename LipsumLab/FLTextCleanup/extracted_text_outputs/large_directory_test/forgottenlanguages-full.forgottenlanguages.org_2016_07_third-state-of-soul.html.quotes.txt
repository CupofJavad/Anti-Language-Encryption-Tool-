Extensive analyses on the subjects who were sent through the Queltron machine showed that their memories are stored in holographic form, rather than photographic, by the brain. That they couldn't recall their memories, either at destination or once they were back, shows we do not quite understand the effects of time travel on one's brain

the objective physical reality which gave rise to your civilization has receded into the past. If you wish to go back in time to recover that objective physical reality you'll find yourself travelling like a sphere of light, wandering through the forests of Sol-3, hovering over its lakes, volcanoes, mountains, and valleys.
