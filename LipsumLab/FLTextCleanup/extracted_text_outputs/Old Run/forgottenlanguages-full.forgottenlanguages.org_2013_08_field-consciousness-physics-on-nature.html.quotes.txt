The essence of the electromagnetic field theory of consciousness is that conscious perceptions – and also conscious sensations or qualia, inasmuch as they can be said to have independent existence – are identical with certain brain-generated spatiotemporal electromagnetic patterns

At such times the attention of the participants seemingly locks onto the “same wavelength,” and individuals often report a subjective shift

The MMI hypothesis proposes that such felt shifts are associated with physical changes in the local environment, i.e., that when the “mind” side of a postulated MMI relationship becomes unusually coherent or ordered, then the “matter” side also becomes more coherent or orderly.
This idea predicts that if mental coherence fluctuates from high to low according to a prescribed plan, and that sequence of fluctuations is repeated, say N times, then random data streams continuously recorded during those N periods ought to positively correlate with each other because they should have been modulated by mind in approximately the same way. This prediction was tested in the present experiment

the electromagnetic field theory of consciousness predicts that in principle, consciousness could be generated using hardware instead of wetware. This single prediction not only renders the electromagnetic field theory testable where the neural identity theory is not – it also opens wondrous vistas with respect to possible future technologies
