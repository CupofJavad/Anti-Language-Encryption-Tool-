she said the eyes of her soul were opened and she beheld the
 plenitude of God, by which she understood the whole world both here and
 beyond the sea, the abyss, and all other things. We 
explained to her that what really happened was that she died, surrounded 
by her spiritual children, in the octave of the Feast of the Holy Innocents, 1309, 
aged sixty-one, and that we transfered her consciousness to a plain in Iowa, 2109, 
and that we did so in order to correct an STO misalignment. We realized the

she came joyous and rosy-faced from the ecstatic encounter with the angels, 
though they were not angels at all, and though her rosy-faced was due to

There are no fallen angels. You belong to no one but yourself. 
Yet, what we do not understand we do not possess, and hence, Norea, 
fully fight to understand yourself, but above all fight for them not to 
understand you, so that they will never possess you..

Your body is a brothel, and your soul is a prostitute. Are those the words 
the archons spoke to you, Norea? Or did they utter soft words about you  
moving round the One, for is you don't, you should be dissolved and no longer exist?
What did they sell to you, Norea? Worse, what did you buy from them? 
Wealth? Immortality? The very moment you trade your free will for immortality 
you become dust in the wind, Norea
