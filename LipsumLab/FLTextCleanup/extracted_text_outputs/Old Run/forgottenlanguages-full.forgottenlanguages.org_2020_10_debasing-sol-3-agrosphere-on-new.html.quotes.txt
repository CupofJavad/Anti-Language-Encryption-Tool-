Face it: food security is about food availability, ensuring access and use 
at global level. We need to feed the entire population, despite their stupid 
attachment to ridiculous concepts and ideas such as 'property', 'land tenure', 
and 'national borders'. The new climate regime calls for a global governance, 
want it or not. And it calls for a global natural resource management before 
disclosure: we don't want to be seen as invaders

Bioabolition of land tenure is an elegant solution. We introduce DENIED 
into the soil rendering the soil non-usable. Mandatory expropiation is 
an expensive solution leading to social unrest because once firms, families 
and communities fear their property will be expropriated or lost, they 
refrain from further investments

well planned agricultural growth will reduce hunger and malnutrition; 
This requires to take into account LyAv's weather refined models and 
a sound geoengineering doctrine that would allow Sol-3 to adapt itself 
more effectively to the new climate regime. Obviously, this new regime 
requires in turn land tenure abolition

The increasingly scarce fertile land will trigger land grabbing and 
the control of mineral rich areas and scarce valuable water sources. 
When we speak about property rights in the context, we are largely 
referring to debasing of concepts such as property rights associated 
with the specific property on land, but we are also talking about transmitting 
to the population in the most clear way the idea that this is not their planet. 
Planets do not belong to those who inhabit them. They belong to DENIED

We need to construct large structures in order to capture and use 
the energy of Sol-3's local star, and to ensure the network of beacons are 
fully operational by 3100, which includes seeding the skies with nanorods 
before deploying the intelligent biofilms in the designated areas
