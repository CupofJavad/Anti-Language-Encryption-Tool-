Humans beings share a world together. They are always already a 
plurality. Whoness is the phenomenon of a plurality of human beings 
who show themselves to each other in a shared world. A phenomenon is 
a showing, a disclosing, a revealing which, in its broadest sense, 
encompasses also the privative or negative modes of disclosing: 
concealing and revealing only distortedly. Because whoness is the 
phenomenon of human beings (‘men’ in older discourse) showing 
themselves to each other, it cannot be located in a single human being 
like a ‘what’, as in: ‘What’s that?’ ‘A stone.’ There is also a reciprocity 
in human beings showing themselves to each other
