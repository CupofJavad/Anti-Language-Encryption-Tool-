if the laws of Relativity allow us to revisit the past, then it never really passed, and a time that fails to pass is no time at all. The Queltron Machine proves what we alreay knew, that you cannot teleport matter, but you can teleport information

Is it possible to send an object or even just information backwards through time, without bringing temporal paradoxes with it? It all looks as if the Universe were a computer in which 'the present' is the runtime, data is read from 'the past', and results are generated in 'the future'


There have been several experiments where photons appear to travel faster than the 
speed of light, and hence backwards through time. However, the real 
test is whether any information can move backwards through time, and so far only once we 
had success in demonstrating causality violations, and it wasn't fun at all

You need to understand that quantum teleportation is not the same as the common term 'teleportation' because no 
matter is transported at all, just information. It is also known as entanglement-assisted 
teleportation because as well as using a conventional communication channel, it uses 
entanglement to transmit quantum information non-locally. However, because classical 
information cannot be transmitted instantaneously, quantum teleportation cannot be 
used for communication at superluminal speeds, so teleportation alone is not a valid 
form of time travel
