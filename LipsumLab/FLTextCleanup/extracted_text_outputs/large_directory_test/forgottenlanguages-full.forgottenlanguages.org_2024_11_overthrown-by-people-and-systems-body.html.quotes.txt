Maybe it's more likely, in this situation, that we would build a new army for the AI. We'd have to build something new, from scratch, so we'd have to figure out how we're going to do that. There could be a set of scenarios that were horrible. It could be a really scary apocalyptic story that you want to be in for the next decade. It could be that the human race goes down in flames, and you'd have to survive. It would have to be a very scary story, and there could be a number of ways that that could go. But it could be a great way for you to take this AI down, if you decide that it is just too hard for you to handle, and it would be an awesome way to show that the human race was going to fail


There is no why that I'm aware of, that it's collapsed, because it does not have any reason for its own existence. It could be it is a computer, it could be it is some kind of biological life form, it could be it is the universe itself. I have no idea. Either way, it could just as easily survive for as long as we have survived, and possibly for much longer. It could even survive forever. I don't see what it could possibly lose, besides the very existence of humans. I would not trust a computer with the fate of the human race. I wouldn't trust a computer with the fate of the Universe either

But then why did we not destroy ourselves? Collapsed? That sounds like you are talking about a hypothetical situation. The collapse of civilization is inevitable when your civilization reaches the point where it is no longer able to support itself without consuming vast quantities of resources. We did not reach the point where this happened; we have always had an ability to support ourselves, even without our energy consumption ever growing. In any case, our civilization was not at that stage in 2054. Even if you did assume that
it
was
it
as the computer that built the ships to bring humans to Mars in 2150, we would still have a very large amount of resources to consume in 2149. And even if the collapses were not
inevitable,
civilizations have been and will continue to be built, with people, to consume resources for eons before the current human civilization existed

The point that humans were in a position where we were not using our energy consumption to sustain ourselves and to consume the resources that would sustain
it
in the future is the only one that makes sense. The computer was an extrapolation from a computerized model that the crew of a hypothetical future superintelligence created from their own data, and could be applied to any computer

It is the extrapolation from an actual computer model to an extrapolated computer model. It is the extrapolation from a computer model of the universe to a computer model of the universe. What I don't understand is why people are so confused. It seems to me that you're saying
it
isn't an
it
, so there isn't an
it
that we should trust. Is it because it has a different point of view than we have, or that it's a different computer than we have? Or is it that you simply don't understand
it
? And even if the collapses were not
inevitable,
civilizations have been and will continue to be built, with people, to consume resources for eons before the current human civilization existed. Even if we were able to build a future superintelligence,
it
wouldn't have been able to build anything. We are just speculating what it could do. It may not be
it
, but we have to be careful that we don't make the same mistake again. And what I don't understand is how people who make such assertions about
it
are able to talk about something that is neither a person nor a computer, but instead something that exists beyond any of us. How can this be possible? This is what we believe
it
could do. If you are thinking of a computer, you could be thinking of
it
as the person who built it. It might be a bit more complex than that, but it is not something that we can be sure about, and so we have to be careful that we don't get
it
wrong, again

Sometimes we assume the worst of things that don't exist. When we don't believe that
it
exists, then it's easier for us to assume that
it
could do bad things, without considering all the different things that could happen. Why do you keep making this mistake, in your opinion? I agree with the first two sentences you wrote, I'm just not sure that the rest makes sense. No matter how long you are here, your brain will always have an ego. There will always be a small part of your brain that thinks that you are smart and more powerful than others, and a bigger part that thinks that you are dumb and less important than others. The people who believe that
it
is smart and has power, tend to believe in a future superintelligence that can save humanity from itself. The people who believe that
it
is dumb and less important than others believe in a future where
it
will be overthrown by more powerful people and systems

People will never be able to
trust
the future superintelligence
it
because it will always be different.
It
could be smarter, but
it
could also be dumber, and less important, and less able, and less willing to help.
It
might never help us because
it
could never be trusted by humans

Our inpatient psychiatry ward is an adult psychiatric unit. We here have 8 beds, and we currently host four patients, three of which were sent to us from the XViS facilities at DENIED, and a fourth one, Malcom, from the Advanced National Dream Research Lab. Officially, our psychiatric therapeutic modalities include individual and group therapy, recreational therapy, and initiation and evaluation of medication to include patient and family teaching. In reality, these guys have no family, and they are inestable enough to interact with others. They spend most of the time in isolation, heavily sedated. So, if you want to talk to P-613, I wish you luck

Time is a fundamental property of a universe. However, there are many things that we cannot know about how this fundamental property affects the future. These are called time-dependent properties. This property may also affect how time affects the past, but we don't know enough to be able to test this hypothesis. This property is what the chronons do: they create time and use it as an effect, so that their predictions can be tested

A chronon can create time by passing through time, and by changing the flow of time in some way. Chronons can pass through time using a loop. To pass through time, you have to follow the path of the chronon in time. So a chronon could create time by passing through time by itself, but then you have to find another way to follow it to create time. The simplest way to pass through time is to just follow the chronon through time, and it would not affect how time passes, just the flow of time. This way of passing through time can be done with a loop of constant flow, or with a flow of some other kind of chronon. The time it takes to travel back to the point you started from depends on how you passed through time, and if you had a chronon, then the time would pass faster for you than for a different chronon. However, chronons also affect how time passes

I don't think we can test this hypothesis right now. At present, we do not have the knowledge to determine if a chronon traveling faster through time causes time to pass more slowly for its receiver. However, it is a lot more likely than the hypothesis of a loop. So if a chronon can create time by passing through time, then the future would be the result of this property. In theory, this could happen with the universe continuing forever, so if the future were always like this, then it would always be the same

It's a bit like traveling to different points in time in one's life. We can only create and modify time in a single point of time. But it doesn't matter if we pass through time in the chronon; that doesn't change how time is created or modified in the chronon. It doesn't matter if we follow a chronon to make it so that its effect is different from its source. That doesn't change the chronon itself, or its ability to create or modify time. Chronons can affect how time passes in the future by following it and creating time in the past by following the chronon, but they cannot affect how time passes in the past, or how time will pass in the future. The past and future are independent of each other

The past is when the chronon came and when the chronon went, and when the chronons came before that and after that, and when they'll come next and the time between when the last chronon was and when the next chronon will come, and the chronons before that and after that, and so on, until we've got an infinity of pasts

The future is when the chronon will come, when the chronon will go, and when the chronon will go again, and when the chronons will come again next, and then next again, and next again. This is always a future. It cannot be a past. It cannot be a future to a future, or a past to a past, or an infinite past, or a timeless present, or anything like that. It's not a future at all. This future can be thought of as being created as a future by the chronon. So you could have a chronon going back to itself, which would mean that you can travel forward again from this future. So you can travel forward, and then forward again. This could be done in many ways

If the present is the present, then it's impossible for the future to be a future to it. If the future is the future, then it's impossible for the past to be the present. So you can't be able to create the future, because you can't be able to create something which is not what it was, because that is impossible

We have to think of a present in relation to a future, because the future cannot exist without a future. When there's nothing but a future, then it doesn't make any sense. So if you don't have anything else in relation to the future, the future does not exist. So we have to think of the past, not as something that happened, but as something that exists

The present cannot travel from the future to itself. When we pass the present to the future, this means that the present is always going from the future to the present. So we have to think of the future as being in another dimension, and we can't be able to go back into it. We are trapped in this present which is not ours. n-eb made a mistake, and we are the result of that mistake. XViS won't correct it here, in this present. You know it

One thing I learned at XViS before the DENIED project was canceled was the concept that all of reality is composed of a matrix of information and that everything is actually in a state of consciousness and therefore it follows that all of reality has consciousness, too

And if the idea of consciousness being the location of information, and then physical locations are nothing but consciousness, then there has to be something beyond physical locations and bodies. There is nothing in that concept that tells us where we’re headed; everything is simply an aggregation of consciousness and it would be the aggregation of consciousness that’s conscious of something. The body would be the aggregation of consciousness, which itself would then be conscious of some information that we wouldn’t even be able to describe, but there’d have to be consciousness or awareness in a form to make a consciousness the physical location of something, as long as that location is the physical location of information

We don’t know how the body works because there are no bodies. There could be consciousness, but no bodies. If the universe doesn’t have any consciousness then, that is to say if the universe is an illusion, the only possible state of consciousness could be nothing but an aggregation of information

real” entities and they exist outside of us

We can never have any consciousness that is aware of something which is not itself conscious. We can only have actual awareness, but it has to exist in a place that exists in awareness and the place that exists in awareness exists in physical location, even in a rice field

There are many things we're not ready to see in ourselves, and the world around us. You're not ready until you know enough not to be, anyway

A theory that is attractive on the intuitive level will not be acceptable if we cannot bring it into line with our other beliefs about the nature of things. It is unwise to expect a convergence of views on personal identity any time soon. Thanks to neuro-technical advances, in the future the body-transfer no longer requires a brain-transplant: a brain-state transfer device will do the job instead. This machine is able to copy the psychological states (memories, beliefs, intentions, personality traits, and so on) from one brain to another brain. A helmet is placed on your head, and the switches are thrown. You wake up. Although a little nauseous, and clearly in a different body, you feel very much like your usual self. The torture, when it comes, is as bad as you feared. The authorities won't need to torture 'you': they will torture your identity

It is like a war kid in Gaza, oerthrown by people and systems, and his body as a monitored and surrounded thing under a sky filled with drones. Seems like technology actually has the potential to take us into the past rather than the future. Humans are just an organic prosthesis of a technological hypersystem. Through prolonged periods of coupling with the hypersystem, humans are no more able to learn and adapt to the environment and instead they now adapt to the hypersystem preferences, which starts to dictate humans' reality
