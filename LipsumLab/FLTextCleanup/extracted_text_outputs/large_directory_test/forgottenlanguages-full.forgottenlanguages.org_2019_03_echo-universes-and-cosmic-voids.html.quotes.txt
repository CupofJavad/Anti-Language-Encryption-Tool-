There are three possible scenarios here. Either the Universe is a computer itself, therefore 
located externally to the system it is controlling (a); or the Universe is a system which contains 
computers internally (b); or the Universe is just the result of a simulation being run by a computer 
located externally to it (c). The question we face is whether we can find a way to discover which 
of these three scenarios does best fit our current observations

The operation of a massive quantum computer to be able to manipulate realistic quantum systems (i.e., Universes)
faces the acute problem of the computer being unavoidably subject to an interaction with the
environment it is controlling. Specifically, this interaction causes decoherence, which in turn 
makes the quantum computer to behave unpredictably. It seems a logical option to place such computers 
at the center of cosmic voids to minimize interaction with the environment, but even in that case you 
are to expect some interaction, which means  those computers could be hackable by another hypercivilization. 
Obviously, the best arrangement would be to have the quantum computer outside the Universe itself, which leads 
us back to the old problem of controlling a system without being part of that system
