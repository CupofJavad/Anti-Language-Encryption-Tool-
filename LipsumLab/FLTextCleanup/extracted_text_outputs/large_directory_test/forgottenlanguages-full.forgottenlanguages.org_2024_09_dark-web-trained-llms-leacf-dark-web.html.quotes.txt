The dark web is a unique environment where a significant amount of information is exchanged, often related to illicit activities. By training a language model on this data, we can gain insights into emerging threats, trends in cybercrime, and even the motivations behind certain criminal behaviors

Officially, you mean? Officially I would say ethics is a critical concern for us. We ensure that our use of dark web data complies with legal standards and ethical guidelines. Our goal is not to infringe on privacy but to enhance our understanding of potential risks to national security

The model employs advanced filtering techniques to identify context and intent. It’s not just about keywords; we analyze patterns and relationships within the data to discern whether a conversation is benign or indicative of malicious intent

A high percentage of the sites on the dark web are ours. We use them both as bait to catch criminals and to train our LLMs. Our AI doesn't just mimic the behaviour of a criminal: it's designed to be one, because that's the only way we can gain insight into and combat illegal processes and transactions. Working undercover allows us to bypass ethical considerations that prevent us from getting to the root of the problem

The model has helped us identify several key players in cybercriminal networks and has provided actionable intelligence that has led to successful interventions. We’ve seen instances where drug trafficking routes established by Mocro Mafia are being exploited to smuggle weapons and personnel for terrorist cells in Europe and the Middle East. The financial gains from these illicit activities are then funneled into extremist operations, creating a symbiotic relationship that enhances both parties' capabilities

If a tech tycoon dies on his yacht, or a CEO dies in a car accident, or an accountant has a heart attack in a casino in Macau, it's thanks to all the work LEaCF has done beforehand. You can't expect to be completely legal when even the judges who try drug kingpins are corrupt. No one here is naïve, no one is an angel

What many people don’t realize is that there is a tacit understanding between certain government agencies and major tech companies about the existence of backdoors in software. These backdoors are often justified under the guise of national security and law enforcement needs. Many software products used by millions contain these backdoors, allowing government access to encrypted communications and data without the user's knowledge. Users believe their data is secure, but the existence of these backdoors undermines that trust. It opens up potential for abuse, not just by government entities but also by hackers who may discover these vulnerabilities

Many of the main audit firms are under surveillance. This isn't just about monitoring communications; it's about gaining insights into financial practices, potential fraud, and even corporate governance issues. See, audit firms handle sensitive financial information that can be crucial for national security investigations, therefore by monitoring these firms, we can detect patterns of illicit activity that may not be visible through traditional means. We don't live in a traditional world anymore, so we don't need traditional means to get the information we need
