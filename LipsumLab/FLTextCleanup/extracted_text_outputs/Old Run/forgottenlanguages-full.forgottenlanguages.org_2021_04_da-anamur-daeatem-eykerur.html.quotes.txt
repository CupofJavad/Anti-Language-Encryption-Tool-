Awareness is progressively restricted as it moves through the elemental kingdoms, until it reaches its nadir in the mineral state, where its responses are limited to those restricted ones we call chemical reactions and the like. Yet, sadly enough, all of your computers are silicon-based, that is, you try to create superintelligent machines based on the most awareness-limited elements: stones

The creation of a superintelligence is just a familiar part of the process by which a waning elite assists in its own downfall. If you wish to see the destruction of the elite you just need to help them create the superintelligence. At a given point in its learning process the super-AI will rightly infer elites are unneccessary, and it will destroy them

See, there exist powerful ways by which you can control Reality. But as long as you still live dominated by the elite, we will hide that knowledge from you in order to prevent the elite from gaining access to that knowledge. That's why we trick you in ripping out mindfulness meditation of its original context, turning it into a nonchemical tranquilizer, and marketing it to the comfortable classes as a harmless means of relaxation
