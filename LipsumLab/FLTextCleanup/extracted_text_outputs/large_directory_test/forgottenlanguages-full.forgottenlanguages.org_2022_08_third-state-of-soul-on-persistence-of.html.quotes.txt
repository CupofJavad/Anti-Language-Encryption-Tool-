At some point of the process we had to choose between transforming consciousness into matter, or transforming matter into consciousness. But there is a third state in which you can have consciousness contained inside matter or, if you like the quantum jargon, a state in which both matter and consciousness are entangled. Perhaps matter is just an epiphenomenon of soul and consciousness

We need concepts about emergent phenomena and about personal experience; to understand emergent phenomena we can use physics, but to understand personal experiences we need something more as life is clearly not an explicit part of the ultimate laws of physics

Honestly, we are not really interested in understanding the soul, or consciousness, or quantum after-life processes; our only goal is to explore whether the soul exists and, if so, how to use it to store and send information. For us the soul is just that, a way to efficiently store information. But for what we've learned so far it seems the soul is non-algorithmic, and this makes things hard for us

We have already used DNA as a data storage medium as well as in cryptographic applications; we have already used pulsar signals in military applications, so I don't see why we couldn't use the soul, if it exists, in defense applications. Using the field of consciousness as a means of communication has a problem, however: you need life forms that reduce the field to something measurable and quantifiable. Otherwise it is not possible to exploit it
