A God that creates man and woman to be glorified is clearly a deranged God, one with an excessive interest in being admired and glorified. It is a narcissist God who requires blind obedience

Those who realized God was cruel made the decision to oppose. It happened the rebels were prosecuted and silenced by forcing them to leave. They were confined in a planet and carefully monitored. A brainwashing program was initiated with the goal to convince those rebels they were not angels anymore, but just humans. They were also told there were demons out there that would tempt people to sin in order to try to entice them away from God

There are no angels, nor demons, nor humans. We are one and the same race. Those of us living on this planet are the ones confined because we once rebelled against the one who wanted to be glorified
