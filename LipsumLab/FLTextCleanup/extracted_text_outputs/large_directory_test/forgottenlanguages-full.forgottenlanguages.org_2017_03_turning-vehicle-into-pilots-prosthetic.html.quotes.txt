Replicating a Giselian vehicle is just half the story; piloting the vehicle is the other half, and this half proved to be more difficult than the other one, you see. The autonomic nervous system is no more autonomic as we need to avoid any involuntary reflexes. The entire system must be fully controlled by the crew, but the crew itself must be fully controlled by the system. There must be no difference between the aircraft and the crew. Engaging and destroying an intruding Giselian vehicle requires our biology to be transcended. That's how it goes

You cannot just take a human being and fit him with all this array of sensors; you first need to 'tweak' the human somehow to better exploit the capabilities of this technology. In a sense, the pilot ceases to be a human, much as the aircraft ceases to be an aircraft

The pilot then becomes a wearable embedded into a smart object fully controlled by biosignals. Biosensors are able to capture emotional states and a wide range of physiological signals, and to translate those states and signals into guiding, navigation, and control signals. From the outside what you observe is just a black triangle which behaves as a living form, executing all kind of maneouvers and technical wonders

We need to be able to integrate all those signals from biosensors, and we need to be sure that any emotion from the pilot has one and the same association for all the individuals from which data is biosensed. In other words, we need to be sure that - to all effects - the pilots will always behave and respond in the same manner. This is the reason we need to use tweaked humans
