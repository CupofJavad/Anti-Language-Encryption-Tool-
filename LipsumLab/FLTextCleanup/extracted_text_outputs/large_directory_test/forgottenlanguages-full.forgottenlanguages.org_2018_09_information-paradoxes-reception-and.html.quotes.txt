The problem is not really detecting qubits of information being sent to us from our own unambiguous future. The problem arises from the fact that all non-linear evolutions treat proper and improper mixtures differently, and so long as this difference is observable it will lead to the need of having an entanglement detector, that is, a device capable of telling whether or not a system is entangled with another. This device should be able to have access to both the past and the future in order to perform this entanglement check, and so far the situation is we can indeed send qubits back to ourselves in our past, but in the past we lack the knowledge to build such a device


Sending qubits back to 1958 when the guys in the 1958 timeline do not even know the concept of 'qubits' means we will never get a response from them. However, the fact that the 1958 Mars Bluff B-47 nuclear weapon loss incident did not involve a nuclear explosion means the qubits sent did modify the 1958 timeline somehow. On the other hand, the second 1958 timeline STO does show that the incident was fatal. If ontological bias affects decisions made, we need to know the exact moment at which those decisions were made

It is by analyzing the way the future affects the past that we can unveil the corresponding theory of time travel. This means we need to perform controlled experiments by sending qubits back to the past and monitoring what happens, though the problem here is our observers in the past do not know how to report back to us their observations as they cannot send qubits into their future. And no, there is no version of 1958 timneline in which they have this capability, or at least we haven't found it yet
