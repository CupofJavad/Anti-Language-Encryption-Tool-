and of all the times the plague broke out in our cities, it did so in the ports where ships full of merchandise obtained by trade or plunder docked because the black death was but the signature of a world of merchants who were in reality pirates, and of soldiers who became armed rabble

What better companion animal can a man who behaves like vermin have than the infectious rat that spreads the plague? And in what else can we place our faith but in that which punishes rich and poor, peasants and nobles, shepherds and cardinals alike? For us black death was the great equalizer, and we gave ourselves to it with absolute devotion

There will be no science, no medicine, no army that can stop the plague, neither now nor in the future, and this because humanity itself is a plague, affected by greed, avarice, lust, which turns everything it touches into merchandise. The streets of the cities will be filled with corpses, today and in the future, until it is learned once and for all that every civilization that turns children into sexual objects, women into prostitutes, men into slaves and beliefs into merchandise deserves to disappear

Verily I say unto you, that you should pull down the statues of your mighty ones, and erect in their place a statue to the black rat. Now, and in the future
