Sustainable Bioproducts, a Chicago-based startup, raised $33 million in  March to create animal protein substitutes using super-efficient  microbes found in the volcanic springs of Yellowstone National Park

Innovative or disruptive solutions are key to responding to changing  consumer demand and to addressing the challenge of feeding a growing world population sustainably

The
California Rice Experiment Station
has found a partner in Albaugh  LLC to help bring their ROXY herbicide-tolerant rice system to market

ROXY rice, which stands for resistant to oxyfluorfen, was discovered in  2014 by Rice Experiment Station breeders. That summer, they identified  29 plants that showed resistance and further testing confirmed nine with  oxyfluorfen resistance. Genetic studies at the station determined the  herbicide-resistance trait is controlled by a single as recessive gene.  That makes it relatively easy to transfer to other varieties

Insect Allies is a research program from DARPA aimed at the development  and dispersal of insect vectors to deliver genetically modified viruses  to crops. The goal is therefore to use insects to deliver viruses  carrying specific traits to modify crops during one growing season.  Karys is a research program from DENIED aiming at developing a mutagenic  agent that would affect the DARPA-developed virus modifying its behavior  in order to affect the seeds of plants and disrupt future growing  seasons. Both programs are a spinoff from Project Pandora, which focused  on umbraviruses designed to pose a lethal constraint on the yield of  opium poppy crops all over the world

The AGP - advanced geminivirus program - resulted in the creation of  DENIED bioweapon. AGP is classified as an extinction level bioweapon in  that it will cause the destruction of each and all of the plant species  on Sol-3. Think of it as the green AIDS. Its main task is the global  disruption of the food chain

New-to-Nature Organisms - NNO's - are specifically produced for biological warfare. They are  designed using synthetic genes and synthetic viruses. But what we are talking here is the production of  a completely different NNO that targets the entire food chain by disrupting plant growth. No plants, no meat. You can do without eating meat indeed, but you cannot do without oxygen to breath

Attacking the food chain is one thing; destroying plant photosynthesis that generates oxygen is just another  as we would run out of oxygen at the same time as we run out of food. Herbivores would starve to death in a few weeks,  and that would be the end, for your days would be numbered

We worked in a DoD-owned experimental rice field in DENIED, near Dubuque, Iowa. Our research focused  on retroviruses which permanently integrate themselves into human chromosomes, as part of Project SEE  - Specifically Engineered Entities for Long Distance Travel - and we never fully understood what role  did the rice field play
