PSV Presence is fitted with a radar that simultaneously scans the entire surroundings of the search area. When a target is detected, the beam director is aligned to it driven by the optical tracking system and the laser is activated automatically. The onboard computer continues tracking until the target is destroyed. Unlike the ABL and the THEL, PSV Presence uses a complex laser-filament-in-mid-air system. Several chemicals are used to produce a chemically excited gas into which laser femtopulses are pumped, delivering the necessary energy to create the plasma-like Mil-Orb

The exact position in the sky in which the filament is created, the length of its plasma channels, and the efficiency of the spectral conversion is controlled by the input pulse parameters, which depend on the nonlinear medium in which the pulse propagates

We can take advantage of the fast electron beam breaking into filaments (due to the Weibel instability) as they propagate in the overdense plasma in order to differentiate hostile Giselian probes from our own Mil-Orbs

While using civilian airplanes as targets, we discovered that when the fast electron beam generated by the PSV Akrij penetrates into a target, a return current is generated. This can disrupt the target avionics, thus mimicking what our aircrafts' crew experience when confronting Giselian probes. We know that the return current induced in the bulk cold plasma effectively balances the fast electron current so that currents larger than the Alfvén current limit can propagate. However, we need two counter-propagating streams subject to Weibel instability in order to generate strong magnetic fields transverse to the fast electron beam direction. These magnetic fields are what cause the electron beam to break up into small filaments, and this would nicely match what pilots describe when in close proximity to Giselian probes

PSV Akrij generates filaments that persist in supersonic exploding plasmas. The vehicle performs a laser smoothing to spatially filter a short duration prepulse to preform a stable plasma in mid air which lasts time enough to complete the mission
