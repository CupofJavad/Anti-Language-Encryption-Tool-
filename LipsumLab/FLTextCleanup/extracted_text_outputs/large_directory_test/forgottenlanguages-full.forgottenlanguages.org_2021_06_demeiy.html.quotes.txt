What, Norea, you forgot Seyle dwelt in marble halls? And that she commanded her slaves to prepare the bath for her? You forgot she was to live to make others happy. Instead, she took the role of a queen. Why your anger against us? Just because we destroyed her palace? Or is it because we raped her, in front of her slaves, and then beheaded the slaves for their not having revolted against her? This we tell you: we will kill any and all kings, queens, and rulers in your world, and be sure we will also kill anyone who obeyed them

You should take care, Norea. Change for the sake of change is as much a cage as tradition for the sake of tradition, or technology for the sake of technology, or knowledge for the sake of knowledge
