The very moment they succeeded in uploading conscious awareness onto a 
computer, they realized they could very well be simulated minds in a 
simulated universe themselves. They suddenly felt purposeless, deeply 
sad... and human

They finally discovered God didn't create the universe. He simply made 
a copy of it, as this is clearly less expensive, in terms of matter and 
energy, than creating actual universes. They felt somehow alienated, 
cheated, and resentment and frustration against God grew in their 
hearts


They thought that by uploading 
their consciousness onto a computer they could outlive their physical 
death, unaware of the fact that in so doing it was easy for Giselians to 
simply break in into the computer and take them all hostage. Actually, 
we are all hostages right now

Beautiful Rachel was happily stored in the quantum computer, I mean, 
what I took as beautiful Rachel was really a copy of real Rachel. It 
happened that due to a random quantum event, the computer evolved to a 
physical state which changed beautiful Rachel into someone else, no 
matter how closely this new person resembled real Rachel... In a way, we 
all need some sort of denial of identity if we wish to have an identity
at all, Norea

Certainly, sorting out the consciousness storage problem requires to 
send the copies of individual consciousness states not just to another 
space, but to another time. That is, any and all copies of a given 
consciousness must be sent either forward in time or backward in time. 
They cannot coexist in the present. It follows a civilization which 
masters the art of consciousness replication must first be able to 
master the art of time travelling. By the way, the reverse also holds, 
namely, if you are able to travel in time then you are able to clone 
consciousness
