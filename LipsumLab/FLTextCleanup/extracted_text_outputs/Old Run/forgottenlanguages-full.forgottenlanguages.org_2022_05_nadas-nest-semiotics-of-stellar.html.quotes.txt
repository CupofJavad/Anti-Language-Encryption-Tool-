Nada
's Nest is a subregion within The Void from where ultrastrong, ultrabright radio signals lasting only a few milliseconds were detected in DENIED. By definition, there is absolutely nothing within The Void. No physically meaningful radio sources exist there, yet we received a consistent train of fast radio bursts coming from that point in The Void. Nada's Nest, in my mind, turns The Void into an artificial megastructure whose meaning escapes me

We
all agree SIMP J01365663+0933473 is a rogue planet, and we all agree DENIED is not. It is precisely all the scientific considerations making the first object a rogue planet what make DENIED and artificial one. Sure, KIC 846285, for instance, can be explained as a star surrounded by an abnormal ring of dust that's causing the darkening, but it can also be explained as an Alderson ring that went wrong during or after its construction

The
entire solar system could be such a megastructure or, at least, some weird moons in it are. But it could also be the case space-time is the definitive hypermegastructure
