See, Norea, there is a red apple in my hand. Tell me, is being read an attribute of this apple? Does being red mean to be an apple? Is 'to be in my hand' necessary for the apple to be? Thus, Norea, is space or time a human attribute? Do you really need time or space to be you? No, you don't

Damn you for all the evil and 
all the suffering you have put into your scheme of things. I would accept the 
facts as facts but that would have no bearing on my ideals and values

Why the tears in your eyes, Norea? Is it because your eyes are not equipped to 
deal with facts and your science is not equipped to deal with meanings and values? The source of your sadness can truly
be found in the dogmas of your science that have pervaded all aspects of your culture. Materialism, Norea, is the 
foundation of your life, any ideas lacking a material basis are regarded by you as lacking 
reality. Well, my child, you are beautifully blind having the beautiful eyes of the losers

Your subjectivity is your only truth. Keep it safe, shield it, protect it with your life. The moment you lose it you are dead, Norea

Norea, now your
soul receives knowledge 
from us. This knowledge can be calibrated and used by mind, but can not be 
changed by mind

Smile, Norea! Religion has today become inconsequential for modern society, and tomorrow science will become irrelevant, too. Your world is still inhabitated by primitive
human 
beings that are primarily motivated by what they believe to be 'rewards' 
and they try to avoid what they regard as 'costs'. Give them a reward. Or give them a cost


In the beginning was the self, the Purusha (the male principle), 
alone, afraid, wondering what made him lonely and fearful. If there 
was loneliness and fear, there could also be company and pleasure. 
Restless, he split himself
