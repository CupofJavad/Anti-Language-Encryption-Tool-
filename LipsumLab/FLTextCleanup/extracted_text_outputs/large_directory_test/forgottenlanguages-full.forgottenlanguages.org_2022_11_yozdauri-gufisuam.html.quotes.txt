Give me your hand, for I'll lead you into the region of all the virtues. Don't take me by the hand, Norea, if for a moment you doubt that the pain of leaving behind everything you believed in is unbearable to you

In ascending to this primary and aboriginal sentiment you have traveled from your mother's womb instantaneously to the centre of the world, where, as in the closet of God, you see causes and anticipate the universe, and your own death, and the death of those you ever loved. Learn this, Norea: you are supplementary to your soul. Fear not. Don't cry tears of sadness for something you never really believed in

Wake up, just so you'll believe it's all a dream. Sleep, only for you to believe that everything is reality. When you were born and opened your eyes for the first time, tell us Norea, what lights were those you saw? And in what language did you cry? Your shadow is the memory of all the times you were not there where you needed yourself the most
