In the old world, Giselian beacons are located in Iran, in the Balkans and in the Nabta Playa. There were developed societies with diversified adaptations focused on domesticated plants and animals in these areas, though whether there were cultural connections between these areas is still a subject of much debate

For what concerns Mesoamerica, Giselian beacons first appear on the Pacific coast of Chiapas and we have located three more beacons in the valley of Oaxaca and in the Tehuacan Valley

Giselian beacons have recently been found in coastal Ecuador and in the area of the ancient Mochica culture of Peru

In the Alaska area, we've found five beacons in the Northwest Coast though this area needs be explored in detail as the ice core starts melting and exposing new sites
