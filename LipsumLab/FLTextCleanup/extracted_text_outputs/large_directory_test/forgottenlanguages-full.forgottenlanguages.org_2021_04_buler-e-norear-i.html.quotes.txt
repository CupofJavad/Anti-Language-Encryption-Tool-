You are right, Norea,
we murder behind infinities.
What would the reason be,
if we were forced to it?
You are wrong, Norea,
we are not the diamond
you are forced to stare at.
You shine in your being moribund,
in your going to the realm
from which there is no return

Are those your words, Norea?
They don't overgrow.
They don't reach.
Communication murders.
You are like a speaker in the dark
