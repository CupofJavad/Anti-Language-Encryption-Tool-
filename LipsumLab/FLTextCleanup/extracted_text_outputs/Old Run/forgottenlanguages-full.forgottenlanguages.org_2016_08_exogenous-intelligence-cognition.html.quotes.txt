Language is such an integral party of being human and that makes it hard to avoid using human traits as a framework for considering the intelligence of non-human beings. Language here is a deep barrier

every species is intelligent in the sense that they survive in their environment; only when they are proven to survive in hostile environments can we be sure they are really intelligent. More specifically, they are intelligent because they apply technoscientific interventions into finite ecosystems to turn them into habitable ones

intelligence is notoriously difficult to define and human intelligence simply can’t exhaust the possibilities out there. Most likely, a truly intelligent life form would be that one capable of replicating the intelligence of other life forms up to the point you cannot distinguish between both the replicated and the replicating species

That exogenous intelligent life form is one that sees us as irrelevant. We just hope they do not consider us expendable, too. The very minute they conclude Earth is more important than earthlings will be our very last minute on this planet
