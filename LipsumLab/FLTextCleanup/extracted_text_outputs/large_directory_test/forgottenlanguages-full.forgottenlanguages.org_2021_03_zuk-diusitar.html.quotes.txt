For an AI system, forgetting is essential. But we don't teach our current AI systems how to forget. As the AI system accepts dozens of information every minute, it would simply go mad pretty soon. The increasing number of information means bigger problem both in terms of data storage and data processing, and will sooner or later lead to exhaustion of system resources. Overexposing an AI system to a vast amount of information is also a way to hack it

Fortunately, humans are busy building neural networks and AI architectures that try to emulate a human brain. This means their machines will ultimately be fail-prone. We would have reasons to worry if they were investing their time and efforts in emulating an insect's brain, but so long as they consider themselves the center of the universe, we have nothing to fear
