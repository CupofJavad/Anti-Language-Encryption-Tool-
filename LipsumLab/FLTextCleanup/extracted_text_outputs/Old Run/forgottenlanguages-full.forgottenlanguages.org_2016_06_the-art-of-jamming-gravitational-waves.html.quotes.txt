The magic-like effects observed during the maneouver of a PSV craft are all guidance, navigation, and control related. We achieved instantaneous space displacement in the early 70s, but we never achieved a working weapon engagement system able to destroy selected targets. We are still quite far from using gravitational fields as weapons

there seems to be very little offered for the success of gravitational control weapons. If you can destroy a multi-billion dollar Mil-Orb with just a FGM-148 Javelin man-portable missile, the entire thing is worthless. In my view, we should proceed with the technology transfer to the civilian sector, giving them the means to build mhd airplanes and space vehicles. For us gravity propulsion is just another tool in our toolbox, but is neither the ultimate weapon, nor the ultimate defense system

PSV-MilOrb-2035 Presence was extensively tested in the Fort Worth and Arlington test areas in 2008. We tested new ways to interfere its GNC and OBC subsystems by chasing the vehicle with two F-16 fitted with Li-Baker HFGW jammers. We concluded there is no need to actually detect a covert gravitational wave communication link prior to its jamming. Rather, it is better to simply sweep the search area with HFGWs at random
