Learn it Norea, this present world gives torment. It is the soul that feels, that suffers, that is wicked or good. You are in reality soul, either good or bad. We do not judge neither your actions nor your thoughts. It is this which by the fine invisible cord of self-interest, binds the soul to itself and impels it to eat of the bitter husk of experience rather than the sweet fruits of truth. Yet at last, like a wayward child, the soul comes through very weariness of the husk to ask for the fruit. Your soul, Norea, sick unto death of the illusions and glamour of the material world, shines. Yet this so called existence is not life. Do you want more of it? Believe us when we say to you you should prefer death rather than a life that is mockery

Your consciousness became fractured by the traumatic experience of time travel. So you suppress, deny, disown and dissociate from aspects of yourself in order to be accepted and survive within the world you were not born into. This is not your world. You simply time traveled to it. See, there are aspects of you frozen in time so they do not come with you into this present

The transformation has its limits and controls, Norea, because the one being dreamed cannot go beyond the bounds of the dream itself and is transformed only during the dreaming. When the dream ends, like a mask that comes off, the dreamed one must return to ordinary reality
