For what concerns UAV's, the technological Rubicon has nothing to do with a new revolutionary propulsion system, or exotic metamaterials, or systems and acuators that allow unconventional maneuvering of the drone. Rather, it has to do with small long-lived batteries which allow our drones to be flown autonomously for long periods of times, something between 120 and 200 hours. That's the Rubicon we have crossed

MilOrbs fall within the field of ferreting: electronic and signals intelligence directed at denied areas of known or suspected active air defense to trigger those defenses into activating search radars, fire control radars, and air defense communications networks. Each time a swarm of MilOrbs fly around a target, the combined action allows us to thoroughly map the capabilities of the target, and to extract sensitive information about response time and battlespace management

It is not only about what is real and what is not real, but it is also about what does the government want us to believe and not to believe. In combat, it is not about what is real and what is not real: it is about making the enemy see things that are not

A MilOrb is silent, is luminous, it can hover over the target, can move very quickly and unconventionally in rapid, straight-line movements, with straight vertical movements, it can turn without any apparent radius in the turn. All in all, it is a pretty incredible piece technology. The funny thing is we have them since 1975

No, nobody has crossed the technological Rubicon and has obtained what some would call the Holy Grail of aerospace engineering. However, we have indeed crossed the technological Rubicon by obtaining the Holy Grail of electronic counter-measures. You rely so heavely on electromagnetic signals that you forgot these signals can be crafted, doctored, shaped, and modified in so many ways as to make you see in your radars what does not exist
