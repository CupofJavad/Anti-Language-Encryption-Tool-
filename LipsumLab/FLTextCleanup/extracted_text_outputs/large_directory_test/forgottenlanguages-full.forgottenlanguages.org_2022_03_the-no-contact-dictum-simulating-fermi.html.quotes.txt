we
discovered consciousness is just a mere general side effect of computation..

If
someone starts a simulation of his past but commits to terminate the simulation if it becomes nested (the simulation starts a simulation), he basically has given himself the death penalty, as he most likely is already in such a simulation

any
ETI needs to solve the Fermi paradox and answer the question of why a civilization does not observe alien civilizations. A way to provide an estimation of their probability distribution in the universe requires running many simulations of other possible civilizations. But what if the ETI itself is inside a simulation in which a super-ETI is simulating the probability for any civilization to finally solve the Fermi Paradox? Assuming the super-ETI requires civilizations to develop independently and isolated from each other in order to never know of the existence of each other (the so-called No Contact dictum), it is clear the super-ETI needs to perform simulations to test how good the No-Contact dictum is working

We
designed a Sol-3 civilization which is highly techno-addict for the reason that the more time people spend on computers, the more often they see photos of the sun instead of the real one. In other words, the lower price of computation increases the proportion of illusions to real things, that is: the more they get addicted to virtual worlds, the cheaper for us to recreate the real universe as we don't need to create real suns and moons. That's the reason Sol-3 2075 civilization was so addicted to virtual worlds


Sol-3
4130 was designed as an advanced superhuman civilization. The purpose of this simulation was to compute the time it takes for such a civilization to finally discover that, if everything possible exists, then there are an infinite number of real worlds and an infinite number of simulated worlds. The design of Sol-3 4130 included the usual filters (extinction level nuclear war, extinction level biological disaster, and extinction level technological catastrophe). The unexpected result was that in year 4130 the civilization collapses due to an extinction level existential disaster: they got fatally depressed, purposeless, and found survival meaningless
