One of the problems with the information is that it is never self-evident nor it is self-explanatory. Information exists only as a potentiality till a medium is in place that can manifest it

Information is any form of radiation that communicates one or more properties of a physical entity to another physical entity. Rest all is data

if we are able to engineer a system coupling by inversion, we could act against the expansion of the universe extracting energy or propulsion from the expansion. Levering exotic energy into high energy holographic diffraction patterns (like MAP) on the cm scale or on the Q
m
scale by exotic Josephson currents could lead to local human generated spacetime expansion/contraction configurations. Regarding propulsion based on fractional linear transforms mapping the quantum compression by inversion to a cosmic expansion, the anisotropic transform resembles the Alcubierre mechanism if expansion is behind and the compression ahead of the spaceship
