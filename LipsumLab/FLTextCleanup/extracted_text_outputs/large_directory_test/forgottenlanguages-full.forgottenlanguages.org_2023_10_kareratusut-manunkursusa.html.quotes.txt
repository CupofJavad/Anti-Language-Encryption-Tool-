During sleep the countless symbols of knowledge, awareness and spirit and spirituality in the dream which man sees during sleep, work for those who reflect upon it. And in this connection, it is also a very detailed x-ray of the intellect and soul, which is automatically prepared under the Divine law and comes in front of man, so that, every wise and realistic person, who cherishes (spiritual) progress, may assess himself

Man in fact, sees himself in the mirror of dream, but he thinks that it is someone else. For, dream is a kind of record of deeds, whose writings are utterly different from the worldly writings, for every word and deed in it is attired in symbolic or allegorical form. It is obvious that the record of deeds which speaks in the language of symbol and parable, is one's own and nobody else interferes in it

It should be known that things are of two kinds: mental and external. The thing which is mental, does not have a fixed form of its own, nor does it have any body, such as: rancour, sleep, greed, knowledge, forbearance, anger, etc. Those which are external have a fixed form and also a body, such as snake, rabbit, duck, water, camel, dog, etc. If someone has rancour, it will come to him in the form of a snake. For, the external form of rancour is snake. Similarly, the external form of sleep is rabbit, that of greed is duck or ant, that of knowledge is water, that of forbearance is camel and that of anger or oppression is dog. This means that, although the mental things are without body or form, nonetheless, the external things serve as their external forms or embodiments, so that the it may convey his sickness and his success in symbolic language in the dream of every person

every civilisation experiences the spiritual death prior to the physical death
