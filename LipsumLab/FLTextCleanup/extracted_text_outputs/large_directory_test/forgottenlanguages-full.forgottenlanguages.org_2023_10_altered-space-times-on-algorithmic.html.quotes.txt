For what we know, consciousness is not inherently tied to physical matter, but can be manifested in any system capable of carrying out the specific algorithms or processes associated with consciousness, and if consciousness arises from specific computational algorithms or processes we have the right to attempt to discover those algorithms. Consciousness is not solely dependent on the biological functions of the brain, but can emerge from the right combination of computational algorithms and information processing

Some people get a glimpse that we are no longer this poor little stranger and afraid in a world it never made, but that you are this universe. And you are creating it at every moment. And you see, if you know that the I (in the sense of the person, the front, the ego) it really doesn’t exist, then it won’t go to your head too badly if you wake up and discover that you’re god

Knowledge involves the comprehension and application of information. See, information is typically objective, impersonal, and can be transmitted easily. It does not require personal understanding or experience, while knowledge is subjective, personal, and often based on interpretation and experience. Knowledge requires individual understanding and assimilation. Knowledge requires a deeper understanding and internalization of information, thus it is logical to state that if we live in a simulation the simulator is run by a K-civilization, and not by an I-civilization

Of course we've witnessed high-strangeness events, anomalous artificial signals, stars that suddenly disappear, glitches in the fabric of reality. Yes, we all have witnessed such events, and yes, we keep records and collected data from those para-physical objects for future analysis. But you know, those are enigmas that are mostly swept under the carpet in a pragmatic attempt to conduct business as usual

There is a fundamental limit —one bit per Planck area— to how much information can be stored anywhere in the universe
