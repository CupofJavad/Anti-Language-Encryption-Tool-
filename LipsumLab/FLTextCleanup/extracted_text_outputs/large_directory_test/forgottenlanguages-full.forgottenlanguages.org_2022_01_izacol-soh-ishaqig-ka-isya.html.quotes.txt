Watch how your people finish their days, Norea. They will see the harbour without being able to enter and will be shipwrecked at the moment when they believe themselves saved

When you feel emptiness, Norea, when you feel that internal starvation, it is so unbearable that you would do anything you can to try to escape the feeling. You will try to fill in the void. But do you really, Norea? Are you really trying to fill in the void with what the void is lacking? Or are you simply trying to distract yourself from the void with your drugs, your games, your food, your shopping, and sex? Truly, you know nothing avoid the void, Norea

You must sink into the emptiness and learn from it and discover all you can about it and fill the emptiness with your own unconditional presence. But you don't know where to start. You need a new conception of whom you are, a new approach to subjectivity and the inner self. You, Norea, need the moment you breath. Breath now, Norea, for you have time traveled

Yes, you were left far behind, raped in a desert, stabbed in a dark alley, prostituded with a marriage. You've been never less, have you Norea? Even the light from the stars is unseen in the vastness of the great ocean of the deep until it touches a surface, and then it becomes. Become, Norea! That's all you need to do: becoming

You nurse resentment and quickly slide back into your evil ways. Revenge is what you want. You did not ever consider forgiveness. Flesh and blood satiate you, not a caress and a kiss. That's why you deeply wish the world to end, the nightmare to fade away, the suffering to cease. Yet, Norea, resentment will kill you before the dawn. Such a powerful poison resentment is. Learn it
