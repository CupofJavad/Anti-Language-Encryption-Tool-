Under technocapitalism, the overwhelming preoccupation is to extract value in whichever way is most effective. Extracting commercial value out of research is therefore acquiring a higher priority than solving any specific technological problem. Profits therefore become the real “problem” to be solved, displacing technological problem solving to a lower plane

We needed to commodify the most elusive and intangible human quality: creativity. We knew dreams are the source of creativity, hence we set forth to commodify dreams. This has proven to be more difficult than we expected. The lesson learned is that commodification under technocapitalism is much more difficult than its counterparts in previous phases of capitalism

The objective of creative power is to create value. Creating value, however, is all about intangibles and it must fundamentally involve creativity in order to occur. The way for commodification to occur is to separate patents, decoded genetic data, formulas, or software code from those who contributed their creative power to make them happen

creativity and new knowledge are social qualities. No one really “owns” them: not corporations, individuals, or even institutions. Creativity and new knowledge depend on social mediation and culture and are therefore both part and product of society; they are “owned” by society at large
