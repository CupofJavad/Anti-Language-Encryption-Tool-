To realize the unimportance of time is the gate of wisdom

Norea, if one accepts the view that the true character of physical reality is only captured by dreams, then one must be prepared to deal with something that is neither spatial nor temporal but more fundamental than either spatiality or temporality

either we have genuine freedom partially to create the present and hence the future,  or otherwise life would be meaningless

Norea, your future, could you but know it, is inescapably part of the universe.  Dreams as the medium for mutual encounter and personal growth is the secret of  the possibility of such a universe
