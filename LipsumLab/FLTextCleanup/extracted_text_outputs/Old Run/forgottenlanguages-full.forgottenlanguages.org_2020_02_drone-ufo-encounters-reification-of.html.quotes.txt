the avoidance of communication is not conscious, but rather a 
side-effect of the optimal use of resources by an artificial entity

Drone-UFO encounters are amazingly higher than manned aircraft-UFO ones.
We suggest that this is so because the prevailing intelligences are 
artificial and they are not interested in biological life-forms. Once the UFO detects 
biomarkers inside a vehicle, it consistently avoids interaction. The case for drones is 
just the case in which two machines meet and, judging from our experience, it seems 
UFOs are more interested in drones than in manned aircrafts

the increasing use of unmanned aircraft to patrol borders to crack down on drug smuggling 
correlates with the increasing number of drone-UFO encounters. It is noteworthy that manned 
aerial means used in the past never reported such a high number of encounters. In one such event, 
the drone was flying some 12,000 feet above sea level when it was approached by an unknown 
flying object which virtually performed a dance around the drone at a kissing distance. The entire 
incident was recorded by the powerful on-board cameras and fully analyzed by SV17q. 
There’s no other airplane out there that can go and fly for the number of hours that drones do, 
and cover the vast distances drones do, so you should expect more and more incidents in the future. Why UFOs show a clear preference for unmanned vehicles 
is a mystery for us
