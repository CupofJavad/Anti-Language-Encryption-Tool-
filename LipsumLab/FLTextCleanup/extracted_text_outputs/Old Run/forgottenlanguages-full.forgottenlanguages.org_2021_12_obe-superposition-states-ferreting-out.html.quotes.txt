arrogant reason seeks to prove truths, evidence, principles, and tries to establish absolutes like God, but which are nothing but ephemeral interpretations dreamed up behind rational blinders

time does not only keep running off in a time-consciousness, but time must also span in the entire ontological structure of what is, namely, it must span the atomic world and the universe

in a dreamless sleep, during narcosis or comatose conditions, and clearly during a near-death experience and an out-of-the-body situation, there are no organic functions experienced. But, in practice, the lived body is the ultimate center of reference. This means that Giselians do not need anesthesia to perform their surgery operations: they simply induce an OBE on the patient, and then peform the surgery. Once the surgery is over, the body regains its functionality

What was shown to be peculiar to the inter-subjective experience of time of the subjects on board the non-terrestrial craft was the inversion of the flow of time, moving from the past to the present, and from the future backward onto the same present. The present was seen as the meeting point of the past and the future

Let's explain it carefully. Giselians have gone a step further: not only can they OBE, they can make their crafts OBE, too. That is, they get on board their UFOs and once inside they OBE together with the UFO. Do you understand what I mean? Thus, the UFO you see is just an OBE-image: no radar track, impossible turns, incredible speeds, all of it is just due to the fact what you take as a nuts-and-bolts UFO is just an OBE image
