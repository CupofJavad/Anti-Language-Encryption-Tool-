The elucidation of the scientific roots of synchronicity and the phenomena directly related to it has made it possible to embed into the collective imagination a new modus vivendi, a philosophy of existence oriented to the search for ourselves as individuals and as a society

The matrix of our reality is spiritual; likewise our reality is also a product of how we are able and willing to create it, from the moment in which the same synchronistic events seem to remind us that we are not passive observers of a cold universe that works like a clock, but also actors of creation. Our psyche is the medium that allows us to remember at all times what we are and what we are part of

Yes, despite all you have shown to me, despite all you said, I still believe in a world where inner clarity will generate peace and union among men, where science will allow us to make unthinkable leaps and where we will probably come into contact with the civilizations of other worlds that, after a long and arduous journey, have learned to cross the sky walking through the gardens of light

All certainty has disappeared, what is the use of asking what is the truth? And without certainty, tell me, has not the credibility of every institution, of the family nucleus, and in short, everything that served to make man a worthy person, disappeared? Look out the window and tell me what you see. I will tell you what you see. You see this: that knowledge, power, work, the army, the family, the Church, the parties, have globally ceased to function as absolute and intangible principles and to a certain degree nobody believes in them anymore, nobody invests anything in them anymore
