An idiotic civilization is the one who is afraid of others, the one who wants to live in the one-man-island. Obviously, any civilization that knows you do not wish to signal your presence will not send any message to you; if they judge you have the technological capability to transmitt messages, yet you don't, they won't bother saying 'hello' to you. The final move of an idiotic civilization is wondering where are all the aliens. This is the Idiotic Fermi Paradox: you are afraid of aliens, yet you wonder where are they

Yours is a self-isolated civilization. Don't blame it on aliens

The capstone to Fermi’s question is the mismatch between the galactic colonization timescale and the age of the galaxy.
Once an interstellar spacefaring civilization develops, it should sweep across the galaxy like wildfire, as viewed on galactic timescales

Gamma-ray bursts are lethal. They occur anywhere in the Universe at a rate of one burst every 3 × 10
6
years, enough to destroy any civilization around. These bursts are certainly lethal if the life forms exposed to those gamma-ray bursts are carbon-based, therefore we reason that our visitors from outside this world are life forms whose biology is not carbon-based or, at least, that they are life forms who are immune to gamma-ray bursts. Whether this is good or bad news we don't know yet

there must be a better way to transform our civilization into an object of possible detection by extraterrestrial civilizations
