the linguist must formulate the laws of the generation of sentences in accordance with the laws of relationships between sound and meaning: these laws are logically prior to the laws of the generation of sentences. If you do not understand these laws, you do not understand the laws of the generation of sentences


The source of the structures of sound and meaning is consciousness. Consciousness is not a passive reflection of reality. Rather consciousness is an active factor that imposes structures both on language and on our total perception of the world
